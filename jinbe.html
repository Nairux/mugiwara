                                <h2>Jinbe</h2>
                                <p>"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the
                                    Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the tenth member of the crew
                                    and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc.</p>

                                <p>Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream
                                    is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and
                                    equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually
                                    becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He
                                    eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during
                                    the Summit War of Marineford. Vegapunk later cloned Jinbe as one of the
                                    Seraphim, S-Shark, to replace the Warlords.</p>

                                <p>Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years later
                                    allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'Ã©tat
                                    against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to
                                    join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom
                                    during the Whole Cake Island Arc. After staying behind in Totto Land to protect
                                    the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the
                                    Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Jinbe is a large blue whale shark fish-man and the current tallest member of the
                                    Straw Hat Pirates. He has a stocky build similar to that of a sumo wrestler and a
                                    face that is commonly associated with various Japanese demons such as the oni. His
                                    yellow eyebrows and sideburns are distinctly shaped like those found on such demons,
                                    in addition to a bulb-like nose and an angular lower lip pointing upwards. He has a
                                    lightning-shaped scar that can be seen from his left sideburn and reaching over his
                                    left eye which he obtained sometime between Otohime's assassination and meeting Ace.
                                    He also possesses two tusk-like conical lower fangs associated with Oni as well; the
                                    rest of his teeth from the upper and lower rows are pretty much the same, albeit
                                    much smaller. He also has a severe underbite, which makes room for his huge
                                    fangs.
                                </p>
                                <p>He has long, two-toned black hair, with two long stripes, colored gold in the manga
                                    and white in the anime, coming from the roots over his forehead and trailing down
                                    the back, a topknot, and tuft of hair on his chin with a slight green hue. This
                                    topknot did not exist during his time as a member of the Sun Pirates, instead his
                                    shorter and flowing black hair trails off halfway to a light color concentrated at
                                    the back of his head. He kept his chin clean-shaven before joining the Sun Pirates,
                                    after which it gradually grew out over time. His hands and feet are also webbed,
                                    typical for a fish-man, and his limbs that are somewhat thin in comparison with his
                                    enormous girth. His gills (which are pale and pinkish in color) are in between his
                                    shoulders and neck.
                                </p>
                                <p>Under his pale red coat (which he swaps for a black one two years later), he appears
                                    to be wearing a Coral colored traditional Japanese clothing covered all over with
                                    black and white square-shaped patterns with the black and white layers alternating
                                    each other (beginning with the black outline from the edge) and ending with a dark
                                    square at the middle of each and every one of them. He also ties this attire up with
                                    a purple obi like a ribbon around his waist.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Jinbe is often seen wearing different traditional kimono of varying patterns: he
                                    wore a karakusa and later a floral design during his time as a member of the Sun
                                    Pirates; he wore square designs during his debut and a plain one after the Summit
                                    War of Marineford. Four years ago, when fighting against Ace, he wore a black gi
                                    instead with fish designs on either side of the chest, and a red sash with a tanto
                                    tied to it. Two years after the war, while waiting for Luffy at the Sea Forest,
                                    his kimono has leaf-patterns. During Caribou's cover story, he is seen in another
                                    one patterned with flowers. For footwear, he appears to wear simple geta on his
                                    webbed feet. His Sun Pirates tattoo is on the middle of his chest. During the Whole
                                    Cake Island Arc, his kimono is yellow and has a Jolly Roger design arranged like
                                    stripes. Additionally, he is also wearing an orange-colored coat. In the Wano
                                    Country Arc, his kimono is yellow with large orange and white diamonds patterned on
                                    it, a red sash, and his coat has a wave design, colored a dark purple that becomes
                                    progressively lighter and finally white at the ends of the sleeves and bottom.
                                    Like everyone else participating in the Raid on Onigashima, Kin'emon briefly gave
                                    Jinbe a Beasts Pirates disguise.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mt-2">As the former captain of the Sun Pirates, a former member of the Seven
                                    Warlords of the Sea, and the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates, Jinbe is a mighty
                                    veteran pirate with great authority and a high level of respect from his previous
                                    subordinates. He is one of the crew's top four fighters along with Luffy, Zoro and
                                    Sanji. Alongside Sanji, Jinbei is one of two members of the crew to fight without
                                    weapons or Devil Fruit powers in combat. Even before he began his pirating career,
                                    Jinbe's childhood in the lawless Fish-Man District imbued him with combat skills
                                    that would allow him to become an elite soldier of the Neptune Army.</p>

                                <p>He battled Portgas D. Ace on equal terms to the point of near-death, despite Ace
                                    possessing Logia powers, in a five-day long fight, and he shared a cell with him
                                    on Level 6 of Impel Down, where only the most fearsome criminals are locked up.
                                    Jinbei's power and influence are so great that him departing from the Big Mom
                                    Pirates would severely diminish their organization's overall strength, and him
                                    becoming a member of the Straw Hats was seen as a major event worldwide. Even CP0
                                    agents commented on his strength and believed he was capable of killing Who's-Who, a
                                    former CP9 agent (who was said to be a rival to the genius prodigy Rob Lucci) and
                                    member of the Tobiroppo, the strongest six Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates. He
                                    was the first fish-man to become a Warlord, with his considerable former bounty of
                                    Beli250,000,000 reflecting the danger the World Government believes he poses.
                                </p>
                                <p>Jinbe possesses immense willpower, being able to completely suppress any emotions of
                                    fear, which renders him immune to Big Mom's lifespan-stealing powers. This was
                                    shown again when he stayed conscious from Big Mom's burst of Haoshoku Haki.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Fish-Man Karate</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Jinbe is an exceptionally powerful and disciplined master of Fish-Man Karate and
                                    Fish-Man Jujutsu with years of battle experience, which he can use to knock away
                                    many opponents at once and grapple with powerful enemies several times his size. He
                                    was a child prodigy, as he was skilled enough to become a black belt at a young age.
                                    By adulthood, Jinbe's skill in Fish-Man Karate has become so immense that his
                                    strikes do not need to make physical contact with an enemy as the water particles in
                                    the air will blow them away a few seconds after the attack's initiation. Another
                                    example of his strength and skill with Fish-Man Karate is that he defeated
                                    Minorhinoceros, one of the four Jailer Beasts who are Awakened Zoan Devil Fruit
                                    users, with a single uppercut. He easily punched Gecko Moria (a fellow Warlord) a
                                    few meters away, almost knocking him out. He also knocked out Charlotte Opera, an
                                    enormous man larger than himself, in one punch. Jinbe's mastery of Fish-Man
                                    Karate allows him to affect all the water within his vicinity, including the water
                                    in a person's body. With this ability, he can harm Luffy despite having a rubber
                                    body. He can also secrete water from his body as Hody did after overdosing on Energy
                                    Steroids.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Due to his tremendous mastery of Fish-Man Karate, supplemented with his physical
                                    prowess, Jinbe can perform sturdy defensive blocks to stop attacks as powerful as
                                    the thrusts from a shadow-strengthened Moria, one of his fellow Warlords. When
                                    reinforced by Busoshoku Haki, he managed to temporarily defend against the gigantic
                                    flaming blade of Big Mom's Cognac and suffered only minor injuries. With a single
                                    roundhouse kick, he countered a punch from the Energy Steroid-enhanced Wadatsumi, an
                                    enormous fish-man who even surpasses an ancient giant in size, knocking him off his
                                    feet and breaking several of his fingers. It should be noted that a few moments
                                    before, Wadatsumi had brutally defeated Surume, a massive kraken well-known for its
                                    monstrous strength. Using his own Uchimizu, a basic Fish-Man Karate technique, Jinbe
                                    could deflect an Energy Steroid-enhanced Hody Jones's Uchimizu, which was powerful
                                    enough to destroy multiple large corals and pierce through thick stone over an
                                    immense distance with relative ease, proving Jinbe's supreme mastery of Fish-Man
                                    Karate when compared to Hody, a fish-man with monstrous strength. Jinbe is also
                                    capable of using a hidden technique of Fish-Man Karate: Buraikan. With this attack,
                                    Jinbe blasts the opponentâs body with a piercing water shockwave. After Jinbe used
                                    this powerful attack, he sent Wadatsumi (who had greatly increased his size) flying
                                    into the air. He also used Buraikan to send Big Mom off the Thousand Sunny with
                                    tremendous force. This was an impressive feat as Jinbe was the first person seen to
                                    knock her down, although she was heavily weakened from her tremendous metabolism and
                                    eight-hour-long craving at the time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He also displays the ability to skillfully manipulate water (or any other liquid,
                                    like tea or juice) as if it were a tangible cloth through Fish-Man Jujutsu, even
                                    using it to attack from a distance. Jinbe demonstrated this ability by splashing
                                    seawater on Gecko Moria's zombies even though he was standing on a battlefield
                                    covered in solid ice. He can cause devastating damage with this kind of technique to
                                    both people and ships, and even managed to flood all of Onigashima with the water
                                    provided by Raizo. With this martial art, Jinbei can also perform advanced grappling
                                    techniques that allow him to use an opponent's size and weight against them, hurling
                                    them into the floor with great force. This allowed him to repel the likes of Big Mom
                                    and Who's-Who, the latter of which had assumed his hybrid form and reinforced
                                    himself with both Busoshoku Haki and Tekkai.

                                <h4>Helmsmanship</h4>
                                <p>As a fish-man who is very familiar with the sea, Jinbe is a masterful helmsman, as
                                    shown when he steered a stolen Marine battleship from Impel Down to Marineford with
                                    little to no damage being inflicted on the stolen ship at all. He managed to
                                    skillfully steer the Thousand Sunny on his first try and even rode the ship within
                                    the 'Green Room' of the gigantic wave homie Big Mom created, using his tacking
                                    skills. Nami described Jinbe's skills as a helmsman as if he were controlling the
                                    ship like his own body.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Jinbe has a vast knowledge of sea currents that greatly aids his helmsman skills, as
                                    he was able to constantly keep out of range of one of the Big Mom Pirates' fleets
                                    when it was pursuing the Sunny. He also managed to effortlessly steer the
                                    Thousand Sunny to evade Smoothie's flying slash with great speed and
                                    maneuverability. When Franky later heard of these accomplishments, he admitted that
                                    Jinbe's skills are necessary to bring out the Thousand Sunny's full potential.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Negotiation</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Jinbe is an excellent negotiator and can calm the tensions that even Nami cannot
                                    handle, as seen when the Straw Hats and Bege had a meeting inside the Fire Tank
                                    Pirates' hideout that quickly became tense.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unlike Nami, who is more charged with the financials of negotiation, Jinbe is able
                                    to negotiate to find the best possible way to form an alliance and maintain a
                                    relationship while he can wisely decide when to start and end the relationship.
                                    Through this, he became responsible for Fish-Man Island as an ambassador when he
                                    became a Warlord of the Sea to elevate the status of Fish-Man Island and carry-on
                                    Queen Otohime's legacy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    King Neptune often handed over the responsibility for diplomatic relationships to
                                    Jinbe during his time as a Warlord. With Jinbe's current status, he remained to
                                    maintain relationships with pirate crews such as the Big Mom Pirates before he
                                    became a full-fledged member of the Straw Hats.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Every time he wants to make a decision based on relationships between Fish-Man
                                    Island and other factions, Jinbe often consults with King Neptune to discuss the
                                    best possible way to maintain the relationship with humans in general; however, the
                                    final decision will be handed over to Jinbe due to his experience at negotiation and
                                    diplomacy.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Haki</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Jinbe is an extremely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki, which he can use in tandem
                                    seemingly effortlessly with his Fish-Man Karate and Fish-Man Jujutsu techniques.
                                    He fought evenly against Ace, a powerful Logia user for five days straight. By
                                    hardening his arms, Jinbei defended against a slash from Big Mom's Cognac for some
                                    time without receiving damage, surprising Perospero. Jinbe's Busoshoku Haki was
                                    advanced enough to withstand the Haki-enhanced Rokushiki techniques of the Ancient
                                    Zoan user, Who's-Who, and he is one of the few Busoshoku Haki users skilled
                                    enough to harden his entire body, or parts of it. His Busoshoku Haki is superior to
                                    Who's Who's, as the transformed Rokushiki user's hardened index fingers broke
                                    against his hardened body.
                                </p>
                                <p>Jinbe is a very skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, which allowed him to sense a
                                    burst of Shanks' Haoshoku Haki. He also felt of the Roulette to be death and
                                    ill-will.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Nico Robin</h2>
                                <p>Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "Devil Child" and the "Light of the
                                    Revolution", is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior
                                    Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the seventh member of the crew and
                                    the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the
                                    crew during the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.</p>

                                <p>Born into a family of archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia and an
                                    unknown man. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to
                                    reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole
                                    survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two
                                    people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a
                                    skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.</p>

                                <p>She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday", serving and
                                    partnering herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord:
                                    Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist
                                    of the Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio
                                    Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Nico Robin is a tall, slender young woman with shoulder-length black hair and eyes
                                    that have dark, wide pupils (her eyes are depicted to be brown in the manga as well
                                    as the tenth and twelfth movies; while in the anime, her eyes are depicted to be
                                    blue cerulean). She also has a long, thin, and defined nose. In the anime, Robin's
                                    skin tone has a slightly darker tan unlike in manga-colored artworks where it is
                                    lighter. Robin also resembles her mother greatly, with the exception of her hair
                                    color and style as well as having a slightly darker skin tone than her. Robin's
                                    limbs are very long, especially her legs, contributing greatly to both her fighting
                                    capabilities (given the nature of her powers) and overall height.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>She has no trademark looks like the others, though her all-purple cowgirl look from
                                    when she was first introduced is often associated with her trademark look. Like
                                    Nami, Robin seems to be fond of revealing outfits as she is frequently wearing
                                    clothing that is either dark in color (often black or purple) or consists of leather
                                    (sometimes both). She is also fond of high heels, they do not seem to affect the way
                                    she walks or her speed.
                                </p>
                                <p>Robin sometimes wears a gold arm band with white fringes attached to it with the
                                    letter N on it, which stands for her family name. She also had a similar one with BW
                                    on it, which stood for Baroque Works, but no longer wears it as she is no longer
                                    affiliated with the group. She has also worn an outback hat on numerous occasions.
                                </p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>
                                    From the Return to Sabaody Arc to near the end of the Fish-Man Island Arc, Robin's
                                    black hair (also lightened in color) has grown longer, which reaches to her lower
                                    back, and it is pulled back, so it reveals more of her forehead and ears. After the
                                    timeskip, her outfit now is a long salmon sarong skirt that has a design of a green
                                    seaweed with red and yellow flowers on the side with ruffles that bares her hips
                                    with a partially-zipped short-sleeved navy blue (sometimes purple in manga and some
                                    other media) leather vest with a V-neck line and an image of her Devil Fruit or of
                                    an actual Chrysanthemum morifolium is printed on the left breast near the shoulder
                                    that exposes her stomach, darker pink (sometimes red in other media) high heeled
                                    pumps, and a lavender pink backpack. She wears white sunglasses with orange lenses
                                    (black in the manga) which she hangs on her forehead and is seen wearing them during
                                    the battle with the New Fish-Man Pirates in the Gyoncorde Plaza.
                                </p>
                                <p>Like Nami, Robin's breasts have also grown much larger and rounder, but her
                                    appearance has not changed much, save for the fact that her hourglass figure and
                                    body curves have become more pronounced. Robin's skin tone seemed to lighten with
                                    color to the point of the manga's skin color (possibly due to the time spent
                                    training indoors). Unlike the other members, Robin did not grow taller as she
                                    remains at 188 cm.</p>

                                <img src="images/robin1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                                <p class="mt-2">At a young age, Robin acquired a bounty of Beli79,000,000 for having the
                                    ability to read Poneglyphs, which told of the Void Century. Her ability to read the
                                    Poneglyphs is by far her most dangerous quality, and the World Government considers
                                    her a huge threat because of this. This has also made her a vital target for those
                                    who understand the significance of the Poneglyphs, mainly for those who want to gain
                                    control of the Ancient Weapons and/or the means to find Laugh Tale, including
                                    Crocodile of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Kaidou and Big Mom of the Four Emperors
                                    and the Five Elders of the World Government.</p>

                                <p>She was branded as being considerably powerful, and supposedly sinking six Buster
                                    Call warships with her Devil Fruit powers. This was all a lie fabricated by the
                                    government: those ships were actually destroyed by Jaguar D. Saul while helping
                                    Robin escape the destruction of Ohara.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Vast Knowledge and Archaeological Skills</h4>
                                <p>Robin is an exceptional archaeologist, with a vast knowledge of history and cultures.
                                    She was able to, for example, correctly deduct the identity of the St. Briss by
                                    merely examining the two-century old remains of one of its dead crewmen.</p>
                                <p>As a child prodigy, she passed her archaeological exams at the age of 8 to become a
                                    certified scholar. She is also the only person alive who can read the language
                                    written on poneglyph tablets, which contain records of ancient history; this was the
                                    true reason why her first bounty was so high, despite being issued when she was only
                                    8 years old.[18] It is revealed that Robin taught herself most of these skills
                                    through researching in the library of Ohara, which she had done without the aid of
                                    her senior colleagues. This shows great aptitude in academics and research.</p>
                                <p>Outside of historic knowledge, Robin also possesses considerable knowledge of most of
                                    the major figures in the world and has at least heard of such individuals and groups
                                    as Red-Haired Shanks, Dragon, Gecko Moria, and the Vinsmoke Family. She is even
                                    aware of top-secret organizations, including the World Government's various Cipher
                                    Pol units (such as 9 and 0). For this reason, she is the main person Luffy turns to
                                    when he wants an explanation of new information.</p>
                                <h4>Devil Fruit</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to
                                    sprout duplicates of any of her body parts from any surface within range. She can
                                    sprout her duplicate body parts from her own body, inanimate surfaces, and even from
                                    other people's bodies. She can even sprout duplicate body parts on top of other
                                    duplicate body parts. She maintains full control of her duplicated limbs and can
                                    perceive sights and sounds remotely through duplicate eyes and ears. The number of
                                    duplicates she can create appears to be unlimited, so long as they are within range.
                                    Usually, when she uses her powers, she crosses her arms and makes an "X" shape
                                    across her chest, though it's shown that she does not necessarily need to do so to
                                    use her abilities.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By sprouting multiple arms from her opponents' bodies, she can use her power to
                                    disarm her opponents, as well as put them into painful submission holds and even
                                    snap their bones almost effortlessly. She can also use this application of her power
                                    to twist and flip her opponents. Her power is excellent for fighting a large number
                                    of enemies at once.

                                <p>Aside from direct combat, she can also use her powers for a number of support
                                    functions, such as forming a net to catch falling comrades or forming a large number
                                    of arms in the shape of wings, giving her the ability to fly for a few seconds. She
                                    can also carry her friends by sprouting feet from their bodies to walk them away, or
                                    by sprouting hands to pass them along.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Robin is a brilliant strategist due to her genius intellect: she is extremely
                                    skilled in using cunning deception and trickery to gain a strategic advantage over
                                    enemies who are more powerful than herself. In Thriller Bark, she is able to exploit
                                    the zombies' complete obedience to their masters, tricking Hogback into giving
                                    orders to the two zombies with Zoro and Sanji's shadows into jumping off the
                                    Thriller Bark mansion, effectively luring them away from Hogback without using
                                    physical force.
                                </p>
                                <p>Due to her having spent years escaping from Marines and World Government, Robin is
                                    also tactically cautious with a strong perception of danger. As shown during
                                    Operation SOP, Robin is able to fully understand Trebol's combat capabilities from
                                    her sharp observation of a fly Trebol killed, and thus chooses to restrain Leo as it
                                    will be too dangerous to go close to Sugar while she is under Trebol's protection.
                                    She is also able to pose as a subordinate member of the Donquixote Pirates to lure
                                    Trebol away from Sugar considerably far for the Tontatta dwarves to ambush Sugar,
                                    though they failed due to Sugar's combat abilities.

                                <p>After successfully infiltrating Orochi's castle and sneaking off to look for the
                                    Poneglyph, she ended up being found out by the Orochi Oniwabanshu. When the group's
                                    leader, Fukurokuju, gives Robin only one chance to explain herself, she shrewdly
                                    thinks to tell them that she's Ushimitsu Kozo to protect the real identities of
                                    herself and her crew. Due to Ushimitsu Kozo already making an earlier appearance in
                                    town, the ninjas see through her lie and try to capture her, only for it to be
                                    revealed that it was one of Robin's body doubles she was using as a precaution in
                                    case she got caught. She escaped back to the banquet and hid herself from the
                                    pursuing ninjas by blending into the crowd. It was working until Komurasaki's young
                                    kamuro Toko, the girl Robin got acquainted with at Sanji's soba noodle stand, got
                                    into trouble when she laughed at the Shogun because of the other guests mocking him,
                                    forcing Robin to drop her mission and protect her instead.

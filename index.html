                                <h2>What's One Piece?</h2>
                                <p>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated
                                    by
                                    Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly
                                    Shōnen
                                    Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 106 tankōbon
                                    volumes as
                                    of July 2023. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the
                                    Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical
                                    treasure
                                    known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.</p>
                                <p>
                                    One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art,
                                    characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics,
                                    reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By August 2022, it had
                                    over
                                    516.6 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it
                                    the
                                    best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in
                                    book
                                    volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the
                                    highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the
                                    Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series
                                    by a
                                    single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008
                                    to
                                    2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million
                                    continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than
                                    1
                                    million copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is
                                    the
                                    only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart
                                    existence since 2008.

                                <h2>Setting</h2>
                                <p>The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more
                                    akin
                                    to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked
                                    people
                                    known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as "Minks"). The world is
                                    governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government,
                                    consisting
                                    of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World
                                    Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is
                                    also
                                    Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their
                                    secret police. While pirates are major opponents against the Government, the ones
                                    who
                                    really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them.
                                    The
                                    central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against
                                    pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label "pirate",
                                    which
                                    includes cruel villains, but also any individuals that do not submit to the World
                                    Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world
                                    also
                                    has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits, which are mysterious fruits
                                    that grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is
                                    Haki, which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting
                                    abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on
                                    certain Devil Fruit users.</p>
                                <p>
                                    The world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range
                                    called
                                    the Red Line. Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand
                                    Line, which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the
                                    Calm Belt, strips of calm ocean infested with huge ship-eating monsters known as
                                    Sea Kings. These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: North
                                    Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue Passage between the
                                    four seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features
                                    enable transport between the seas, such as the use of Sea Prism Stone employed by
                                    government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt, or the
                                    Reverse
                                    Mountain where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a
                                    rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line
                                    itself is
                                    split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradiseand the
                                    New World.

                                    caravel that served as their main transportation through the East Blue, and the
                                    Grand Line up until Water 7. It was often affectionally referred to as simply Merry
                                    (メリー, Merī) by the crew.</p>

                                <p class="shipArrangement">The Thousand Sunny is the second ship of the Straw Hat
                                    Pirates, built after the Going
                                    Merry was destroyed. It is often referred to as Sunny (サニー, Sanī) by the crew.

                                    It is a brigantine-type ship designed and built by Franky with help from Yokozuna,
                                    Iceburg, and the remaining Galley-La foremen who were among the best shipwrights in
                                    the world.[1]

                                    Built from Adam Wood, it is a magnificent ship of the finest craftsmanship at least
                                    double the size of the Going Merry. Its features include practically all of the
                                    various requests the Straw Hats had before arriving in Water 7.</p>

                        <p>Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese
                            manga artist and the creator of the series One Piece (1997–present). With more than 516.6
                            million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece is both the best-selling manga
                            in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of
                            the best-selling fiction authors. The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of
                            the manga artists that changed the history of manga.</p>

                                <h2>Brook</h2>
                                <p>"Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two
                                    swordsmen, and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the
                                    ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join, doing so at the end of the
                                    Thriller Bark Arc.</p>

                                <p>Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life after death
                                    once. Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit,
                                    giving him significant control over his own soul and the souls of others.</p>

                                <p>Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was resurrected through the
                                    power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the amount of time it took for his
                                    soul to find his body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping only his afro
                                    intact. Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually
                                    meeting Luffy and serving as the Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc
                                    before officially joining the crew. His dream is to reunite with his old friend,
                                    Laboon, at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <h4 class="mt-2">Before Death</h4>
                                <p>Before his death, Brook was a tall, tan, skinny man who had a rather distinctive
                                    face. He had a slight goatee on his chin and some side burns. He typically wore
                                    shades never revealing his eyes. On his forehead was a scar that slightly resembles
                                    a diagonal omega sign (Ω). This scar was retained in his skeletal state as a
                                    distinctive crack across his skull. Brook's facial appearance, accompanied with
                                    his style of clothing, resembles a type of appearance and style that is commonly
                                    associated with various music artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Jimi Hendrix, Slash,
                                    and other musical celebrities with similar features.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>Brook is an extremely tall skeleton dressed in formal attire complete with top hat
                                    and cane. Standing at 266 cm (8'8½") in height, he is the second tallest member of
                                    the Straw Hat crew, having been edged out by Jinbe. Despite having no skin, he still
                                    has an afro which he says is because his hair has very strong roots. Brook's style
                                    was that of a gentleman consisting of a coat, top hat, trousers and afro, which were
                                    black, while the inner linings of his coat were yellow-orange. The cravat that was
                                    tied in between his coat and around his neck was blue. The outer covering of Brook's
                                    cane sword which he carries was purple. Also, due to his many years of seclusion his
                                    clothes were somewhat tattered.
                                </p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>
                                    During the Return to Sabaody Arc through Fish-Man Island Arc, he changed to more
                                    colorful and high-end clothes, as though to represent a rock star. He had
                                    heart-shaped sunglasses, a yellow feather boa, a new top hat with a giant crown on
                                    the brim and orange red trousers with a floral design. Despite being a skeleton, he
                                    grew to 277 cm (9'1") during the two-year timeskip.
                                </p>
                                <p>During the Wano Country Arc, Kin'emon used his ability to change Brook's appearance
                                    so he could blend in with the country. Brook now wears a pure white kimono, with
                                    triangle-shaped headband and two arrows stuck in his body - an appearance befitting
                                    of a ghost, as Kurozumi Orochi's Oniwabanshu members mistake him as a gasha-dokuro.
                                    Before the Raid on Onigashima, Brook wore a samurai armor complete with a kabuto
                                    helmet and cape. He also wields a katana rather than his shikomizue. When departing
                                    for Onigashima, Brook traded his samurai armor with a black vest and cravat and also
                                    a top hat. Like everyone else participating in the raid, Kin'emon gave Brook a
                                    Beasts Pirates disguise with a dark-colored furred coat and one-horned hat.</p>
                            </div>


                        </div>

                        <div class="col-lg-12">

                                <h3 class="mt-1">Abilities and Powers</h3>
                                <img src="images/brook1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                                <p class="mt-2">As much as Brook normally goofs around on the ship engaging in acts of
                                    silliness with Luffy, he is still a formidable opponent. Due to his previous
                                    experiences and skills that he amassed from the days when the Pirate King Gol D.
                                    Roger was still active, Brook, in all respects, is a veteran pirate (though these
                                    attributes are somewhat downplayed by his overall demeanor, along with the fact that
                                    his isolation in the Florian Triangle seemed to have eroded his knowledge of modern
                                    society). Brook is a talented swordsman, has extraordinary speed due to his
                                    light frame, and is astonishingly difficult to harm because of his undead state.</p>

                                <p>Brook has demonstrated tactical ingenuity, as shown when he used his music to act
                                    like he was on Giolla's side, allowing him to regain his sword from her and defeat
                                    her. He also got the idea to store the copies of Big Mom's Poneglyphs inside his
                                    head before she confronted and later captured him. He is very good at working
                                    with others to execute plans in tandem, as shown when he took advantage of Pedro's
                                    distraction to get around his strongest opponents and enter the Room of
                                    Treasure. He also disguised himself as a clone of Luffy to take advantage of the
                                    chaos when Luffy crashed Big Mom's tea party, and he destroyed Big Mom's portrait of
                                    Carmel without being noticed.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Musical Skills</h4>
                                <p>Brook is a virtuoso musician who is extremely skilled in playing all kinds of
                                    instruments, particularly the violin, his favorite instrument. After he was
                                    separated from the Straw Hats, Brook picked up the guitar and, within two years, he
                                    became so highly skilled in the new instrument that he came to be regarded as a
                                    world-famous rock star. At testament to this fact, his records in Tone Dials sold in
                                    the millions, and his fans during his final world tour stop in Sabaody Archipelago
                                    were either crying or fainting at his presence. Brook can masterfully play
                                    enchanting songs that are so melodious they can completely captivate even animals
                                    like Laboon, who used to sing along to Brook's music. In addition to singing and
                                    playing music, Brook is also a skilled composer, having composed songs such as "Bone
                                    To Be Wild" and "New World", which proved to be very fashionable among music fans
                                    and lovers.</p>
                                <h4>Devil Fruit</h4>
                                <p>
                                    While he was still alive, Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil
                                    Fruit that allowed his soul to return to the world of the living and reinhabit his
                                    body after he died. This allows him to reside within his own dead body, which
                                    had already decomposed into a skeleton by the time his soul found its way back to
                                    it, and he can even perform all the functions he did when his body contained flesh
                                    and muscle. Other than bringing him back from the dead, Brook's fruit initially
                                    seemed useless. However, he later discovered that he could exercise the power of his
                                    strengthened soul, which he discovered is what allows him to animate his body.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He can make his returned soul temporarily separate from his body so that it can move
                                    independently of his body, effectively making him a ghost. This leaves his body a
                                    lifeless husk, but as a spirit, Brook is capable of moving through walls and going
                                    to areas that would be impossible for him to physically reach, though he cannot grab
                                    hold of anything.
                                </p>
                                <p>If his skeletal body is broken into pieces, he can extend soul tendrils to the
                                    severed body parts and pull them back into place. He is also capable of exerting his
                                    soul power to affect and overwhelm beings with weaker souls, such as Homies.
                                </p>
                                <p>His soul energy exudes pure coldness, called the "chills of the Underworld", and
                                    allows Brook to transfer this freezing aura to objects, like his sword. With
                                    this aura, he is capable of freezing his surroundings, as seen when he turned the
                                    ground around him on Zou into ice.

                                <h4>Swordsmanship</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Brook uses a type of sword called a shikomizue, a sword concealed inside a cane. He
                                    uses this sword in conjunction with his fencing skills and has had it for at least
                                    fifty years.
                                </p>
                                <p>As a former battle convoy leader and pirate captain with years of experience in the
                                    Grand Line, Brook is a master in swordsmanship. Despite his usual goofy personality
                                    in battle, he is an extremely skilled swordsman who is able to dispatch numerous
                                    enemies at once with swift and precise strikes. His swordsmanship is a combination
                                    of classical fencing and iaidō.
                                </p>
                                <p>Brook's Gentle Blade style is more focused on speed and precision while Zoro's style
                                    is more focused on power and thus uses a tremendous amount of physical strength.
                                    Brook was unable to defeat Ryuma no matter how hard he fought and while Ryuma only
                                    used a fraction of his power, he noticed that Zoro was able to defeat him at full
                                    power with only two of his swords, although Ryuma did say that Brook's
                                    protectiveness of his afro held him back somewhat.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After the timeskip, Brook has named his sword "Soul Solid", due to him developing
                                    the ability to coat it with the aura of his soul, freezing it in the process, and
                                    anyone who comes into contact with it. He also claimed that the Longarm Tribe has
                                    helped him sharpen the sword. His power and skill in swordmanship have also
                                    increased to the degree where a samurai from Wano has commended his skill and he is
                                    also now able to use flying slashes as well, which were on par with Zoro's and
                                    Kin'emon's. Like Zoro, Brook can now cut materials that are harder than
                                    steel as he was able to cut down a dragon, whose scales are tougher than steel.

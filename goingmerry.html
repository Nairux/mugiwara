                        <h2>Going Merry</h2>
                        <p>The Going Merry was the first full-sized ship owned by the Straw Hat Pirates, a
                            caravel that served as their main transportation through the East Blue, and the
                            Grand Line up until Water 7. It was often affectionally referred to as simply Merry
                            (メリー, Merī) by the crew.</p>
                        <h2>Ship Design and Appearance</h2>
                        <p>The Going Merry had a jib and a central steer rudder. The ship's armaments consisted of four
                            cannons, one in the bow pointing forward, one in the stern, and two pointing to either side.
                            They were rarely used, as the Straw Hat Pirates usually preferred to run away or engage in
                            hand-to-hand combat. After the Arlong Park Arc, the Going Merry gained three tangerine trees
                            from Bell-mère's orchard, a memento of Nami's home. As the crew traveled through the first
                            half of the Grand Line, the ship received more and more damage and gained several metal
                            patches to hold her together at places that could not be nailed back together: prominent
                            examples are Merry's figurehead and the mast, which was torn off several times. Several
                            spots of the guardrail were damaged and missing, leading the crew to patch them up with
                            wood-boards, which was done rather crudely due to their lack of experience in carpentry. By
                            the time it reached Water 7, the keel was damaged, which was considered to be irreparable in
                            the long run, thus dooming Merry. In the Skypiea arc, the body of the ship had wings and the
                            sheep figurehead was dressed as a chicken.
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite the incredible amount of damage, the ship accumulated over its travel through the
                            Grand Line, it had a miraculous resilience in that when Kaku released it to drop down a
                            waterfall, it did not smash apart, but instead landed on its side, undamaged from the fall.
                            With Iceburg's expertise in patching it up to extend the limited time it had, the Going
                            Merry was able to sail through the treacherous storm of the Aqua Laguna, all the way to
                            Enies Lobby and back before finally succumbing to its limits.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In volume 11 of the manga, Oda presented various schematics and explanations of each part of
                            the ship. These included everything from Merry's figurehead to the kitchen.

                            used this room for his <b> Usopp's Workshop.</b></p>

                        <p>The steering pole used to maneuver the ship is located in this room. It has a sheep's head
                            similar to the one used for the ship's figurehead. By tilting the pole left or right, the
                            rudder at the stern will move in that direction.</p>

                            It is quite large and untidy. This room is normally crowded due to the fact it is shared by
                            Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Chopper, and Sanji to sleep. It is accessed through a hatch next to the
                            mast. There are a total of five hammocks located here to sleep on. There is an emergency
                            exit that connects to the women's room in case something should happen.</b></p>

                        <p class="mt-2">A storage room and a cannon deck are located under the lounge of the Going Merry. This is
                            where the crew keeps all their cargo such as beer barrels, water barrels, rations, and
                            treasure boxes in storage. Any treasure that Nami cannot keep in the women's quarters is
                            kept here as well. The room also houses two cannons facing each side of the ship.</p>

                        <p>The bathroom and the women's quarters can be accessed from here. Some towels can be found
                            next to the bathroom's entrance for when one finishes taking a bath. The hatch going down to
                            the women's quarters had a latch to keep out prying eyes.</p>

                        <p>The steering shaft that is used to steer the ship can also be seen located above this room.

                        <p class="mt-2">The women's room of the Going Merry is located under the storage and cannon deck. This is
                            where Nami and Nico Robin (and for a time, Vivi) usually sleep. It was originally designed
                            by Merry for Kaya's use, resulting in its beautiful and well-decorated design. The room is
                            accessed through a hatch that leads to the room above. This hatch had a lock. There is an
                            emergency exit that connects to the men's room located here in case something happens. This
                            hatch, however, is not normally used and is usually locked.</p>

                        <p>After the Arlong Park Arc, a bar was added here by a carpenter from Cocoyasi, Teru-san.

                            contains giant oars and life preservers for use when called for.</p>

                        <p>The cannon here was notably used to fire at Laboon before the Going Merry rammed into him

                        <p>The bathroom features a shower, a bathtub, a sink, and a toilet. When Robin was frozen by
                            Aokiji, the bathtub was used by Chopper and Usopp to thaw her out. The water in the
                            bathroom is drawn up by a special machine located underneath the stairs on the top deck.
                            There used to be two of these machines, but Luffy broke one.

                        <p>
                            Care must be taken after using the shower. After cleaning themselves, the crew must make
                            sure to thoroughly clean the bathroom with a rubber wiper in order to prevent the ship from
                            being weakened by moisture.

                                <p>After Luffy and Usopp's battle in Water 7, these trees were moved to the hotel room
                                    where the
                                    Straw Hats were. They were luckily found by the Galley-La shipwrights and moved to a
                                    safer
                                    location before the Aqua Laguna hit.</p>

                                <p>They, along with the rest of the Straw Hats' belongings, now reside on the Thousand
                                    Sunny.

                        <h3>Legacy</h3>
                        <p>On board the Thousand Sunny, Franky announced that the Thousand Sunny will carry on
                            the spirit of Going Merry. This is shown more literally when Franky later introduced
                            the Straw Hat Pirates to the soldier dock system and it was revealed that channel 2
                            houses the Mini Merry II, a four-passenger steamboat almost identical to the
                            original Merry, so much that Usopp declared that she was Merry's "reincarnation";
                            the main differences are that it is much smaller and has a steam engine with paddle
                            wheels.</p>
                        <p>Usopp, who was so dedicated to saving Merry that it blinded him from the truth to the
                            point of nearly severing his ties with the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates, came to
                            realize his mistake upon Merry's funeral. Although difficult, he accepted that he
                            had to let the ship go, and eventually went to apologize to the crew before being
                            re-accepted.</p>

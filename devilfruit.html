                        <h2>Devil Fruit</h2>
                        <p>Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for
                            permanently granting their eaters superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to
                            swim. With only one notable exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single
                            Devil Fruit and survive.</p>

                        <p>Each Devil Fruit grants a special power to anyone who eats it, from the simplest powers
                            possible, such as stretching like rubber, to powers capable of causing large-scale
                            destruction like creating earthquakes. Each Devil Fruit is unique, and there is no other
                            like it; that is, there is no Devil Fruit that has the same power as another. These fruits
                            are broadly grouped into three classes: Zoan, which allows a user to transform into an
                            animal as well as an animal hybrid; Logia, which grants a user the power to create, control,
                            and transform their body into a natural element; and Paramecia, which offers any of a vast
                            array of strange abilities that do not fit into the other two categories.</p>

                        <p>Devil Fruits have empowered many of the world's most significant individuals, especially
                            among the Three Great Powers. This, along with their general rarity, causes them to be
                            highly sought-after; single specimens may be valued at hundreds of millions in Belly, and
                            extensive efforts have been made to mass-produce artificial versions for warfare.</p>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Devil Fruits come in all different shapes and colors, though all the Devil Fruits seen so far
                            have possessed swirl marks or patterns. The only known exceptions are artificial Devil
                            Fruits, which have ring patterns on them. The oldest introduced Devil Fruits are the Toki
                            Toki no Mi and Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, which have existed in the world for at least
                            eight centuries.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is currently unknown what Devil Fruits are exactly, where they came from, or exactly how
                            they work. Dr. Vegapunk theorizes that Devil Fruits are a manifestation of the possibility
                            for human evolution, with all the different powers representing the many branches for
                            humanity's future, brought into existence by human hope and desire: thoughts along the lines
                            of "if only I could do this" or "if only I could be like that". Vegapunk claims that those
                            with powers exist in different dimensions dreamed up by others before them. However,
                            according to Vegapunk, those who exist in this unnatural state are loathed by the sea, which
                            he describes as the mother of nature, and thus become unable to swim as punishment. It is
                            unknown how much of Vegapunk's theory is true, but it is a fact that consuming Devil Fruits
                            alters a person's Lineage Factor, which grants them supernatural powers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It should be noted, however, that Devil Fruits, despite the immense power they grant, are
                            not what determines whether or not one can conquer the sea. The real defining factor is
                            generally considered to be Haki. A clear and notable example of this rule was Gol D. Roger
                            and Edward Newgate; Newgate was considered the "Strongest Man in the World" and he possessed
                            the power of the Gura Gura no Mi, the Devil Fruit called the "Strongest Paramecia," which
                            granted him the power to generate powerful quakes and shockwaves and could potentially
                            destroy the world. However, even when Newgate was in his prime, he was still matched and
                            bested by Roger, who did not have a Devil Fruit. Roger conquered the Grand Line with the
                            power of Haki, achieving a feat that multiple powerful Devil Fruit users, including Newgate,
                            Charlotte Linlin, Kaidou, and Shiki, all failed to accomplish, even decades after Roger's
                            death.

                        <p class="mt-2">After being consumed, a Devil Fruit gives the consumer a superpower or a special
                            superhuman trait, which they will soon become aware of, and the consumer will keep these
                            powers for the rest of their life; a person who has eaten a Devil Fruit and gained its
                            powers is known as a Devil Fruit User (能力者, Nōryoku-sha, lit. "Power User" or "Esper).
                            There are more than 100 different Devil Fruits in the world, but only one of each Devil
                            Fruit exists. Additionally, all Devil Fruits are known to taste very bad and cause
                            the consumer to permanently lose their ability to swim.</b></p>

                        <p>Only one bite is needed for the user to gain the power of the Devil Fruit, after which the
                            Devil Fruit becomes a simple, useless, disgusting fruit. Despite this, the majority of those
                            who have consumed a Devil Fruit have elected to eat the entire fruit, as they appear to be
                            unaware of this fact. Furthermore, the consumer gains the powers and drawbacks of the
                            fruit immediately after the fruit is swallowed, without needing to wait for the fruit to be
                            digested.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A person can only eat a single Devil Fruit in their entire lifetime; any attempt to gain a
                            second Devil Fruit power will cause the consumer's body to be blown apart to such a degree
                            that little trace is left of it, resulting in their death. The reason for this is currently
                            unknown; Jabra heard a rumor that an actual devil lives inside each fruit and transfers to a
                            fruit user's body upon consumption, and would fight with the devil inhabiting another fruit
                            if they were to meet within the same body. However, this rumor is said to have been debunked
                            by science.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is a method that would allow one to steal the Devil Fruit powers from the dead body of
                            a deceased Devil Fruit user. The details of this method are currently unknown. The only ones
                            who know this method are Marshall D. Teach and his crew.

                        <p class="mt-2">There is at least two versions of a Devil Fruit Encyclopedia (悪魔の実図鑑, Akuma no
                            Mi Zukan?) that identify Devil Fruits. The only known information about the old Devil Fruit
                            Encyclopedia is that it has no mention of the Gomu Gomu no Mi according to Vegapunk.[30] The
                            newer version lists the names and powers of all the Devil Fruits. However, only a few have
                            illustrations, meaning that most Devil Fruits cannot be identified by their appearance. For
                            example, the Gomu Gomu no Mi and the Yami Yami no Mi had supplementary pictures and could be
                            recognized before consumption,[31][32] whereas the Awa Awa no Mi and the Ushi Ushi no Mi,
                            Model: Giraffe do not, and could only be identified by the abilities they granted.[29] This
                            would imply that the information in the book is incomplete, and that there are still Devil
                            Fruits out there with attributes that have yet to be documented.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Devil Fruit</h3>
                        <p>Each and every Devil Fruit is categorized into one of three types/classes, based on the type
                            of power they grant. The three types are Logia, Zoan, and Paramecia.</p>
                        <h4>Paramecia</h4>
                        <p>The most common of the three Devil Fruit types, Paramecia-type Devil Fruits grant their users
                            any one of a wide variety of superhuman powers; these powers include things like shock wave
                            generation and locking onto targets. Paramecia Fruits can alter features of the user's body,
                            granting them a slippery physique, a body of blades, or the ability to split their own body
                            into pieces harmlessly. Some Paramecia Fruits allow the user to modify the people, objects,
                            and environment around them by making things levitate or turning people into toys. Finally,
                            some fruits exist that allow users to generate and manipulate substances, like wax or
                            poison.</p>

                        <h4>Zoan</h4>
                        <p>The users of Zoan-type Devil Fruits gain the ability to transform into a specific animal, as
                            well as transform into a hybrid form that combines attributes of their own species and the
                            species the fruit allows them to transform into. Unlike other Devil Fruits, Zoan-type fruits
                            are said to have a will of their own. A recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be
                            integrated into inanimate objects, bringing the object to life and granting it the standard
                            Zoan transformations.</p>

                        <p>
                            Zoan fruits greatly enhance the users physical abilities and are the best kind of power for
                            augmenting melee combat. Carnivorous animal Zoans are better suited for combat due to their
                            predatory attributes. Some Zoan even grant special abilities based on the animal, such as
                            the king cobra Zoan allowing the user to spit globs of poison, or the mole Zoan allowing the
                            user to dig through the earth, even through solid stone, at high speed.
                        </p>

                        <p>Aside from most Zoans that transform their users into animals that currently exist, there are
                            three known sub-classifications:</p>

                        <ul>

                                <p><strong>Ancient</strong> - Zoan Fruits that allow the user to transform into an
                                    extinct species,
                                    such as dinosaurs. Ancient Zoans are rare, and they appear to be stronger than
                                    regular Zoans. Some have even displayed atypical physical abilities that their users
                                    claim the real animals naturally possess.</p>

                                <p><strong>Mythical</strong> - Zoan Fruits that allow the user to transform into
                                    mythological creatures, such as a dragon or a phoenix. Mythical Zoan animals tend to
                                    have additional special powers, like a phoenix Zoan being able to generate flames
                                    that have healing powers. Mythical Zoans are the rarest type of Devil Fruit, even
                                    more so than Logias.</p>

                                <p><strong>Artificial</strong> - Artificially created Zoan Fruits that cause the user to
                                    permanently take on an animal characteristic; though, much more rarely, the user
                                    becomes able to transform at will. The artificial Zoan Fruits had a 10% success
                                    rate, while the other 90%, in addition to not gaining animal traits and losing the
                                    ability to swim, were stripped of the ability to express negative emotions, leaving
                                    them only able to smile and laugh, regardless of how they actually feel. These
                                    artificial Devil Fruits, known as SMILEs, were developed by Caesar Clown and
                                    Donquixote Doflamingo. Another version was developed by Vegapunk.</p>

                        <h4>Logia</h4>
                        <p>The rarest and most powerful of the three Devil Fruit types, Logia-type Devil Fruits allow
                            their users to create, control, and transform their body into a natural element, such as
                            sand, mud, smoke, lightning, plant life, and even darkness. There are also Logias that can
                            transform the user into artificial elements like paper or candy syrup, but these are
                            considered non-canon.</p>

                        <p>
                            The elemental transformation effectively makes the user intangible, as well as allowing the
                            user to remain in control of their body, even when it is broken into pieces. They also gain
                            every ability related to that element, such as sand being able to absorb moisture or light
                            being able to travel at light speed. The darkness element and its power of all consuming
                            absorption has the unique ability to nullify any other Devil Fruit power upon contact with
                            the user. Some Logia Devil Fruits even grant the user an infinite amount of space inside
                            their elemental body.

                        <p>Devil Fruit powers can, in rare instances, achieve "Awakening" (覚醒, kakusei), significantly
                            increasing the user's abilities. According to Kaidou, awakening occurs when a Devil Fruit
                            user's mind and body catch up to their powers When a Devil Fruit's power is awakened,
                            the increased abilities have been seen to allow significantly greater power, more refined
                            control, and new abilities that would otherwise not be possible. The effects of the
                            awakening depend on the type of Devil Fruit.</p>

                        <p>It has been noted that it takes time to fully master awakened powers; if they are not fully
                            mastered, they can still be used, but they take a serious toll on the user's stamina.</p>

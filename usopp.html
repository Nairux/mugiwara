                                <h2>Usopp</h2>
                                <p>God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers
                                    of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fourth member of the crew and the third
                                    to join, doing so at the end of the Syrup Village Arc. Although he left the crew
                                    during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.</p>

                                <p>Usopp is the son of Yasopp and Banchina. He was born and raised in Syrup Village,
                                    serving as "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After
                                    working with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited
                                    to join the crew. Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave
                                    warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up
                                    to this dream.</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>Usopp is a slim tan-skinned teenager with medium-length black curly hair, prominent
                                    lips and a long nose, which is apparently an allusion to Pinocchio (a wooden boy
                                    from a story of the same name who possessed a nose that would stretch after he
                                    lied). Usopp inherited his famous nose from his mother, while the rest of his face
                                    closely resembles his father's. During the Straw Hat separation, after landing in
                                    the Boin Archipelago, Usopp grew obese from overeating.
                                </p>
                                <p>Like the rest of the males of the crew, he wore one outfit for the majority of the
                                    series before wearing different clothing by the end of the Paradise. Usopp usually
                                    wore an olive green plaid bandanna, a blue and white striped armband on his left
                                    arm, along with special sniper goggles (he also has a pair of clear rectangular
                                    goggles that he sometimes wears in situations where he does not have his sniper
                                    goggles, like when he first met the Straw Hat Pirates or when his sniper goggles
                                    were stolen by Mr. 2), brown overalls with a white sash and no shirt underneath. He
                                    also carries with him a yellow satchel, which he stores all his tools and gadgets
                                    in.</p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>After the two year timeskip, Usopp has become much more muscular than before and has
                                    grown his hair out. He has become "manlier" and is slightly taller than before.
                                </p>
                                <p>Usopp now has a new pair of goggles around his neck (his sniper goggles weren't
                                    shown) and has some headphones or ear protectors on. He also now has a little goatee
                                    along with a new white sun cap he wears on his head. He also has a new pair of
                                    rolled-up yellow pants with red suspenders and a pair of boots.</p>
                                <p>His trademark yellow satchel has been replaced with a red one, but he still has his
                                    blue and white striped wristband on his left arm.</p>

                                    <p class="mt-2">According to Oda in a discussion with Mayumi Tanaka, Luffy's voice
                                        actress, 'no matter who joins, he always wants Usopp to be the weakest'
                                        since it would upset the balance of the story. Oda also states that this is
                                        because Usopp is the only one in the entire crew who is the closest in strength
                                        as compared to a regular human.</p>

                                    <p>Since early in the series, he has struggled to match the physical feats of the
                                        stronger characters and needed his weapons or ammunition to take out foes. He
                                        used to be a huge coward and often wanted to run away immediately, a trait he
                                        still carries to a lesser extent after his two years of training. This, coupled
                                        with him getting easily distracted or confused in battle have often made him
                                        less effective than his real potential as a sniper. So far, he appears to have
                                        moved past this after his training and takes better advantage of his wit and
                                        strategy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Both his physical and mental strength have all increased greatly during the
                                        two-year timeskip, as he was able to quickly dispatch all of Caesar's men on his
                                        own. While many of his attributes lie mainly in his ability to hit nearly
                                        anything he sets his sights on with his slingshot, he is now shown to be strong
                                        enough to keep both Robin, Luffy, and himself afloat in freezing water.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Marksmanship</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Usopp is an extremely skilled sniper. Since early in the series, he was shown to
                                        have inherited much of his father Yasopp's exceptional marksman skills. He has
                                        exceptional marksmanship and is capable of turning slingshots into
                                        formidable and terrifying weapons. With his skills used in conjunction with
                                        unique ammunition, such as the Firebird Star, Usopp can deal devastating damage
                                        in long-range combat. In addition to his slingshot, he also has great skill with
                                        cannons and other forms of Naval Artillery, enough that the crew views him not
                                        only as a sniper, but as their gunner, responsible for operating and maintaining
                                        their ship's cannons and artillery as well as using them. His skills include
                                        using the ship cannons and the Gaon Cannon of the Thousand Sunny.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        His marksmanship is nearly unmatched, accurately hitting Spandam and some
                                        Marines from a vast distance of over a mile out-distancing even the guns the
                                        Marines had with the wind against him. In order to stop Sugar a second time, he
                                        demonstrated his ability to calculate and predict trajectory angles, influence
                                        of wind and distance, and even incorporating booster shots into his projectile,
                                        thereby allowing him to hit his target located indoors, physically located too
                                        far away to even be visualized, through a small opening in a window.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Usopp also has extremely sharp eyesight and has on more than one occasion seen
                                        or noticed things before his crewmates. Examples of this include being the first
                                        one to see Gecko Moria inside the stomach of the gargantuan zombie, Oars, and
                                        being the only one able to see the harpy Monet watching them on Punk Hazard.
                                        Later at Onigashima, Usopp quickly spotted some lookouts before anyone else and
                                        put them to sleep with his Pop Greens.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Engineering Expertise</h4>
                                    <p>One of Usopp's prominent abilities is his resourcefulness and understanding
                                        towards engineering (such as easily understanding the tunnel networks made by
                                        Miss Merry Christmas). Prior to Franky joining the crew, Usopp served as the
                                        Straw Hats' sole unofficial gadgets and mechanics specialist. His creative and
                                        resourceful engineering has resulted in the creation of both the Clima-Tact and
                                        Kabuto which he can further modify with dials and pop greens. He also appears to
                                        be highly knowledgeable in chemistry, being solely responsible for manufacturing
                                        the highly innovative slingshot pellets, or "stars", that he uses for
                                        ammunition. An example of scientific knowledge is in his battle against Caesar
                                        Clown. He understood that even though Caesar Clown had the Gasu Gasu no Mi,
                                        therefore making him a Logia-type, he would still explode if he was exposed to
                                        fire as he was still just gas. He also understood that a plan would not work as
                                        Caesar Clown was in control of the gases around him and that if he removed the
                                        oxygen from the atmosphere, the flame would no longer burn.</p>
                                    <p>For other more complex activities, such as acting as the shipwright for the Going
                                        Merry, he is largely inexperienced, as he was barely able to keep the Going
                                        Merry going doing patchwork repairs. As Franky pointed out, his skills are
                                        amateur, and he barely knows how to use a hammer correctly for such jobs. After
                                        Franky joined the crew, Usopp gladly let him take over maintaining the ship,
                                        even agreeing to Franky's request to assist him. In return, Franky provided a
                                        workshop for Usopp to work on his gadgets and creations, something he is more at
                                        home with. Even Franky admitted that his skills in gadgets are incredible.</p>

                                        Usopp has awakened his Kenbunshoku Haki during the latter half of the Dressrosa
                                        revolt, as he was able to see auras of Luffy, Law, and Sugar, who were in the
                                        royal palace, from the old King's Plateau near the Corrida Colosseum. With this,
                                        he was able to pinpoint Sugar's location and snipe her down from such a
                                        distance.

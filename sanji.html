                                <h2>Vinsmoke Sanji</h2>
                                <p>"Black Leg" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the Straw
                                    Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is
                                    the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the
                                    Baratie Arc.</p>

                                <p>Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus, making him a
                                    former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth
                                    and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as
                                    a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie,
                                    where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his
                                    crew.</p>
                                <p>His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where the East
                                    Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is
                                    one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who are
                                    referred to as the "Monster Trio".</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Sanji is a slim, muscular, long-legged man with blond hair which he keeps brushed
                                    over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was the left side. After the
                                    two-year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It
                                    also appears that Sanji's hair is less straight and scruffier after the
                                    timeskip.</p>
                                <p>Among Sanji's physical traits are his distinctive eyebrows. Both form a spiral but at
                                    different ends. His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end, while his left
                                    eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. His eyebrows curl in the opposite direction
                                    from his siblings, whose eyebrows curl in a counterclockwise direction (i.e., to the
                                    left side). Sanji's eyebrows instead curl in a clockwise direction (i.e., to right
                                    side). During his battle with Queen, when his dormant genetic modifications
                                    awakened, Sanji's eyebrows switched to curling in the same direction as his
                                    siblings' (i.e., to the left side). After being unconscious for a brief
                                    period, when he awoke, his eyebrows had returned to their original shape. When
                                    fighting S-Shark, his eyebrows changed direction again.</p>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>He wears dress shoes, mostly for his Black Leg Style. These shoes are extremely
                                    durable and were designed to increase the power of his attacks, though he can attack
                                    sufficiently without them as shown in his fight against Kuroobi. Sanji is also a
                                    chain-smoker and is rarely seen without a cigarette.
                                </p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>After the two-year timeskip, Sanji now covers his right eye, shows his left eye, and
                                    has grown his hair just slightly longer. He also sports a dark anchor style facial
                                    hair, and stubble on his upper lip. Sanji's neck has gotten thicker as well, similar
                                    to Luffy and Zoro. He has grown taller, and therefore remains nearly the exact same
                                    height as Zoro. He wears a black double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a
                                    yellow dress shirt together with a brown tie. In Punk Hazard, he wears a full black
                                    double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a grey dress shirt together with a very
                                    light grey tie.
                                </p>

                                    <p class="mt-2">As the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates, Sanji provides an extremely
                                        valuable service to his crewmates. Alongside Luffy and Zoro, Sanji is considered
                                        one of the Monster Trio (怪物三人組, Kaibutsu San-ningumi?) of the Straw Hats due to
                                        his strength. Because of their role as Luffy's main support, Zoro and
                                        Sanji are referred to as the Pirates King's Wings (海賊王の両翼, Kaizoku-ō no
                                        ryōyoku?). Despite his great strength, Sanji tends to be underestimated by
                                        the World Government and has almost never been in the top three highest
                                        bounties, with one exception after the events of Whole Cake Island, when he
                                        ranked third. Sanji currently has the fourth highest bounty in the crew after
                                        Luffy, Zoro, and Jinbe, at Beli1,032,000,000. Alongside Jinbe, Sanji is one
                                        of two members of the crew to fight without weapons or Devil Fruit powers in
                                        combat, until acquiring the Raid Suit, but then abandoned it as his dormant
                                        genetic enhancements awakened.</p>

                                    <p>While Luffy often fights the strongest enemies, Sanji and Zoro often end up
                                        fighting against enemies considered the second or third primary threat. However,
                                        Sanji's and Zoro's opponents could be often characterized as matching (or
                                        countering) their particular fighting styles, such as his fight against another
                                        leg-based martial artist, Mr. 2, during the Arabasta Arc, while Zoro fought
                                        against Mr. 1, an assassin who ate a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that made him a
                                        Fullbody Bladed Human resistant to swords. Although Sanji and Zoro usually let
                                        their rivalry impede their fighting performances, they have proven to be a
                                        near-unstoppable force if they agree to cooperate for the battle.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a former prince of the Germa Kingdom, it can be assumed that Sanji would have
                                        had the same political and military power possessed by the rest of his family.
                                        However, due to his decision to renounce his title and status as a royal (as
                                        well as his father's decision to cast him out of the family), Sanji has
                                        willingly given up any and all claims to these kinds of advantages. Despite
                                        this, it has been shown that he still retains political authority over the Germa
                                        Kingdom's subjects as shown during his childhood, where the rest of the kingdom
                                        treated him with the same respect as they treated the rest of his family
                                        (despite his family's own poor treatment of him), and when he returned to the
                                        kingdom after 13 years, they continued to do so.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Culinary Expertise</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Self-taught since childhood and also personally trained by Zeff, Sanji is an
                                        exceptional culinary master of the highest caliber, possessing immense knowledge
                                        and the capability of preparing almost any kind of delicious food with a strong
                                        sense for the aesthetics of cooking. He cooks with amazing speed and dexterity,
                                        particularly in his use of knives. His sense of taste is also not lacking.
                                        Often, he is able to deduce the qualities of aspects (i.e., ingredients and
                                        methods of cooking and preparation) involved in a prepared dish in a very short
                                        period of time. He has an extremely sharp sense of smell, as he correctly
                                        figured out all the ingredients Streusen used for the wedding cake and even
                                        perfectly figured out Streusen's secret recipe solely by its fragrance, a feat
                                        that completely shocked Chiffon and the 31 Head Chefs of Whole Cake Island.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>According to Chiffon, Sanji's cooking skills have surpassed even Streusen, Totto
                                        Land's finest chef. He was able to completely remake a giant wedding cake in
                                        less than twelve hours, where it took Streusen several days to make the first
                                        cake. The cake was so delicious, it made Big Mom, a sweets enthusiast who had
                                        spent her entire life eating all sorts of treats from all over the world, fall
                                        into a state of absolute bliss that she had not known since her sixth birthday
                                        party.</p>

                                    <h4>Genetic Modifications</h4>
                                    <p>When Sanji was a child, he was weaker than his siblings (who always outpaced him)
                                        to the point that he was considered a disappointment and a failure to his
                                        family. This was due to the drug that his mother took during her pregnancy to
                                        ensure Sanji would still have his humanity, thus resulting in him being born
                                        without any apparent genetic enhancements, much to Judge's fury.</p>
                                    <p>However, during the Raid on Onigashima, Sanji noted that after three uses of the
                                        Raid Suit that his body began to feel different, and even in some cases,
                                        "better", which perplexed him early on during his fight with Queen. Later
                                        on, in his fight with Queen, Sanji angrily realized that the genetic
                                        modifications that laid dormant within him since birth have finally awakened,
                                        granting him a superhuman physical constitution and an exoskeleton that makes
                                        him nearly invulnerable, including an accelerated healing rate. After surviving
                                        being crushed to death, Sanji stood back up, even with all of his bones broken,
                                        shocking everyone as his body snapped back into place and reformed. Queen then
                                        struck Sanji with his sword, only for the blade to shatter against Sanji's neck,
                                        with Sanji only feeling minor pain and annoyance as a result. He would then
                                        pull his cheek back into place and also withstood several bullets to the head by
                                        the Beasts Pirates without any injury.</p>
                                    <p>After realizing that his genetic modifications only awakened due to him wearing
                                        his
                                        Raid Suit, Sanji chose to accept the changes to his body, but not before
                                        destroying
                                        the canister that held his suit to permanently cut off his ties to Germa. After
                                        mastering his new gifts to some level, he discovered that he has become so fast
                                        that
                                        it is as if he can become invisible without the suit and his already impressive
                                        strength has grown to a level far greater than he would have imagined. By
                                        combining all these augmentations to his body and his Busoshoku Haki, Sanji
                                        developed fighting techniques that would have been physically impossible for him
                                        to
                                        do before. He has not displayed the total lack of empathy associated with his
                                        brothers' genetic enhancements, as he was horrified when he thought he was
                                        responsible for hitting a woman as his powers were manifesting.</p>

                                    <h4>Haki</h4>
                                    <h5>Kenbunshoku Haki</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Sanji is an extremely skilled user of Kenbunshoku Haki, which is his
                                        specialty. During his stay in the Kamabakka Kingdom, Sanji trained his
                                        Kenbunshoku Haki to become an advanced master of it due to being on a constantly
                                        careful watch for the harassment from the okama day and night who sought to
                                        steal his manhood. He can sense the presence, strength, emotions, and intent of
                                        others. Most remarkably, Sanji could even dodge a jelly bean shot by Charlotte
                                        Katakuri despite the Sweet Commander possessing a higher level of Kenbunshoku
                                        Haki.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Busoshoku Haki</h5>
                                    <p>Sanji is a highly skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. During his fight with his
                                        father, he blocked his spear by hardening his right leg. Sanji damaged Luffy
                                        despite his rubbery body when they fought on Whole Cake Island. Having awakened
                                        his dormant genetic enhancements, Sanji combined his sturdy exoskeleton and
                                        Busoshoku Haki to enhance his legs, allowing them to endure much hotter flames,
                                        resulting in the creation of Ifrit Jambe.</p>

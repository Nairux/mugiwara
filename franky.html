                                <h2>Franky</h2>
                                <p>"Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior
                                    Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the crew's eighth member and the
                                    seventh to join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.</p>

                                <p>Born "Cutty Flam",[18] he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually
                                    permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his
                                    identity. Originally from the South Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family
                                    as a four-year-old, eventually making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a
                                    member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily
                                    damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water
                                    7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty
                                    hunters.</p>

                                <p>Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning
                                    of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of
                                    the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and
                                    circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the
                                    Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream.</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>As a direct result of the modifications that he conducted upon himself as well as the
                                    years spent as a ship dismantler, bounty hunter, and street thug in Water 7, Franky
                                    is a powerfully built man with a height of at least seven feet, making him the
                                    third-tallest member of the Straw Hat crew, after Jinbe and Brook. His forearms are
                                    relatively enormous while his biceps are comparably small. His chest is well-toned
                                    with large abs and pectoral muscles. He has brightly colored blue hair and blue star
                                    tattoos on his forearms. Franky's eyebrows are rather long and stern, and he has
                                    three prominent lower Matsuge on each eye. His chin is very angular and tapers off
                                    in three pointed clefts. Franky has an equally angular prosthetic nose made of iron
                                    with several rivets and jagged edges, the only replacement part of his exterior body
                                    that is not covered in artificial skin.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>His choice of clothing usually comprises of a swim briefs, which causes people to
                                    call him a pervert, and an open loud Hawaiian "Aloha" shirt with a large golden
                                    chain necklace around his neck. It is rare for him to button up his shirt, have long
                                    sleeves, and wear pants or footwear unless the situation calls for it, or someone
                                    makes him do so. He also does not like it when people tamper with his look, as seen
                                    when Nami's mind was inside his body and she tried to button up his Hawaiian shirt,
                                    which made Franky upset.
                                </p>
                                <p>Before becoming a cyborg, Franky went half-dressed simply because he wanted to. Now,
                                    his cyborg body is built in a way that covering himself up actually limits him from
                                    accessing its features (long sleeves prevent him from using weapons installed on his
                                    arms, a buttoned shirt stops him from accessing his chest panels, pants keep him
                                    from using features on his legs that cause them to separate or expand, shoes are a
                                    hindrance for the same reason and also redundant because his feet are toughened with
                                    iron). If in a battle, Franky will strip down for the sake of using his weapons or
                                    wear specially modified clothing that can transform along with him. Conversely,
                                    Franky always makes sure to cover his back (hence, he wears a shirt) because it is a
                                    weak spot- it is still flesh and blood, the only part of his body he cannot reach
                                    and modify. Unfortunately, Franky is still susceptible to cold and can suffer chills
                                    from his half-nakedness.</p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Over the two years he was on his own, Franky used Vegapunk's blueprints to
                                    drastically reconfigure his body, repairing the damage he accidentally caused to
                                    himself and replacing some old functions his body used to have with better and more
                                    powerful implements. Franky's hair is now controllable and can change different
                                    styles instantly by pushing his nose for more than three seconds. While he used to
                                    wear it up in a pompadour style, he now frequently changes his hairstyle, typically
                                    whenever he wears a new outfit. However, he reverts to his original pompadour style
                                    whenever he is inside General Franky.
                                </p>
                                <p>He appears to have made modifications to his eyes as well. What appears to be his
                                    eyes are actually lenses that resemble human eyes over a pair of robotic eyes
                                    underneath. His left eye was seen with inverse coloration and with a glowing red
                                    pupil after his battle with Senor Pink, after being knocked around so much it caused
                                    the lens over the eye to fall out. Once the fighting against the Donquixote
                                    Pirates had come to a close and Franky had some downtime to repair himself, he
                                    installed a replacement lens.</p>
                                <p>
                                    His shoulders, torso, and arms are also much bigger than before, and with studded
                                    hands that look almost robotic in appearance, but he also revealed that inside of
                                    his huge arms he still has a set of normal-sized robotic hands. He now appears to be
                                    wearing metal rigged suspenders. He has replaced his elbows with large, light blue
                                    hinges, his shoulders with a large red ball and socket joint with "BF-37" written on
                                    them, and his forearms with large, light blue cubes, with his trademark star tattoo
                                    being split by an edge. Surprisingly, Franky's forearms also have hair on them even
                                    though they are clearly robotic, and his large robot hands can even wear gloves.
                                    These new features house upgrades he gave himself during the timeskip.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mt-2">As the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates, Franky is an extremely
                                    valuable asset for the crew since he maintains the Thousand Sunny's condition, along
                                    with the other vehicles, instruments, or weapons the Straw Hats may employ. He is
                                    also an accomplished surgeon, as he was able to operate on himself twice, even
                                    though Franky does not specialize in the field: an especially notable feat, as
                                    Franky was close to death when he did so the first time.</p>

                                <p>In terms of combat ability, Franky is one of the most dangerous Straw Hats, a feat
                                    acknowledged by the World Government given his current bounty of Beli394,000,000.[3]
                                    By combining his immense physical prowess with his advanced bionic enhancements,
                                    Franky took down two CP9 agents - Nero and Fukurou, the latter a master of
                                    Rokushiki. After studying on Karakuri Island for two years and returning to his
                                    crew, Franky's considerable fighting skills significantly increased, in tandem with
                                    his engineering abilities. Franky emerged victorious over three officers of the
                                    formidable Donquixote Pirates: Baby 5, Buffalo, and Senor Pink, easily defeated the
                                    Energy Steroid-enhanced fish-man, Ikaros Much, and knocked out Jaki, an inebriated
                                    ancient giant, with a single attack. It was only against Sasaki, one of the Beasts
                                    Pirates' Tobiroppo and an Ancient Zoan user with a bounty of Beli472,000,000, that
                                    Franky was temporarily overwhelmed, though the cyborg was able to land a finishing
                                    attack after a lengthy, harsh battle.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Construction and Engineering Expertise</h4>
                                <p>
                                    n addition to his cyborg-enhanced body, Franky is also a master craftsman, being a
                                    first-rate shipwright and an exceptional carpenter from working under Tom. As both a
                                    former employee of Tom's Workers and one of Tom's apprentices, Franky's skills as a
                                    shipwright are top-notch and well versed. This was evident in his youth, when he
                                    helped in the construction of the first Sea Train, the Puffing Tom alongside Tom,
                                    showing that his skills as a shipwright extended to naval architecture as well. He
                                    helped to achieve this feat, while in his spare time also continuing to build his
                                    own line of thirty-five specially designed, numbered battleships named the "Battle
                                    Frankies", with each ship capable of killing a Sea King. After Tom's death, Franky
                                    decided to atone for his death by dismantling ships instead of building them. As a
                                    Ship Dismantler, he regularly took apart ships and other vehicles from pirates and
                                    looters, and even established his own group of dismantlers called the Franky Family,
                                    who helped Franky collect loads of materials from the ships they dismantled. They
                                    obtained, purchased, and sold said materials through dealings in the Underworld, due
                                    to the questionable methods they use to get by in Water 7. Franky used this method
                                    for years to not only continue their dismantling business, but to personally build
                                    their base, arm his group with weapons, give them plenty of money and supplies, and
                                    even make uniforms for them that can take cannon fire.

                                <p>
                                    Despite all this, even his years of dismantling had not affected his carpentry
                                    skills in any way. The best proof of this was when he was able to finish the
                                    construction of the Thousand Sunny, with the aid of Iceburg, Yokozuna, and the
                                    remaining Galley-La foremen, under a short period of time. Franky is also a
                                    brilliant and creative inventor with which he used to create his cybernetic body
                                    that has a vast array of weapons and incredible might that allow him to fight
                                    opponents with inhuman physical prowess on equal ground; he also equipped the
                                    Thousand Sunny with incredible gadgets, weapons and even the capacity of flight. His
                                    scientific intellect also allowed him the ability to self-taught and grasp the
                                    concept of the blueprints and technology of the revered scientific mind of Vegapunk,
                                    which were left behind in one of his labs on Karakuri Island, and thought to be
                                    impossible to create, complete, and even understand. After his two years of training
                                    on that island, Franky successfully proved his ability to not only understand his
                                    technology, but also recreate it. The greatest example of this feat is Franky's
                                    addition of the light lasers to his arsenal, which was a form of technology that
                                    only Vegapunk himself was originally able to create. Franky was also able to
                                    realize Vegapunk's concept of a transforming robot with the use of the recently
                                    discovered alloy Wapometal. Franky's engineering skills even extend to gadgetry as
                                    well, as he had helped Usopp with upgrading Nami's newest Clima-Tact.

                                    A scientific genius of his own right, he developed a cannon-like mechanism that
                                    accumulates air rapidly within a confined space right before releasing it as a
                                    compressed air-based projectile powerful enough to bring down large establishments
                                    as well as provide a superb means of propulsion, which served as a template that
                                    gave birth to the creation of his "Coup De Vent" functions. He designed the Thousand
                                    Sunny himself featuring several unique functions like the Coup De Burst and the
                                    Soldier Dock System.

                                <h4>Cyborg Body</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Franky is a human with artificial parts commonly known as a cyborg. His front is
                                    heavily armored and insensitive to most attacks, while his back, where he could not
                                    reach, remained vulnerable. His body is equipped with a wide variety of weapons,
                                    including rockets, an extendable right arm, the ability to breathe powerful flames
                                    as well as being able to release powerful blasts of air from multiple parts of his
                                    body. His stomach contains a refrigerator compartment that can hold up to three
                                    bottles of cola to fuel him and his attacks. His personality is also affected by the
                                    type of beverage that is stored in his refrigerator compartment. He can use up large
                                    amounts of cola in an instant to launch powerful bursts of air from his arms,
                                    utilizing these blasts for techniques such as the devastating "Coup de Vent".
                                </p>
                                <p>After two years of research Franky successfully merged his own technology with the
                                    science of the renowned genius Dr. Vegapunk.[20] with nearly all of the futuristic
                                    and state-of-the-art technological aspects of the Marines and the world as a whole
                                    (i.e. the Pacifista project and the assimilation of Devil Fruits into weapons) have
                                    been incorporated into Franky's upgraded bionic modification.
                                </p>
                                <p>It is also worth noting that Franky's original transformation into BF-36 was
                                    initiated as a quasi-surgical operation of necessity to save his life, and it is
                                    assumed was accomplished with some modicum of haste from a medical standpoint, since
                                    he suffered from massive external and internal injuries; whereas the process to
                                    become BF-37 was a two year-long planned process done with highly advanced machinery
                                    in an abandoned fully-stocked, scientific laboratory, on his preexisting cyborg
                                    body, so Franky's own experience being one beforehand was likely factored in when
                                    customizing its schematics and functions, as well as understanding whatever notes
                                    and information of scientific research that Vegapunk left behind.
                                </p>
                                <p>Franky even went the extra mile with his modifications, adding utility functions like
                                    his "Franky Nipple Lights", and nonsense functions like his pop-out hair feature.
                                    With all this in mind, post-timeskip Franky is truly a force to be reckoned with.
                                    The scientific weapons that Franky has displayed so far in the post-timeskip are
                                    noticeably more offensive and destructive than his BF-36 weapons. So far, he has
                                    revealed explosive missiles housed in his large shoulders, and a modified "Coup de
                                    Vent" known as "Franky Radical Beam", that fires a powerful explosive laser beam
                                    instead of air, along with other powerful weaponry. He also features more advanced
                                    and powerful variations of the BF-36 artillery such as an improved flamethrower
                                    installed in his body that allowed him to breathe out large fireballs and the
                                    machine guns installed in his new cybernetic hand to rapid-fire bullets in
                                    long-range combat. The fact that he was able to have laser beams in his arsenal
                                    despite the fact it was said that only Vegapunk was able to create them further
                                    proves Franky's engineering mastery. His engineering skills also extend to anatomy
                                    as he modified himself into a cyborg and was able to perfectly understand Vegapunk's
                                    notes on animal modification and his Pacifista project.</p>

                            narrator who is currently affiliated with Max Mix. He is married to actress Natsuki
                            Hayashi.In 1985, Yao played the role of Shinobu Fujiwara in the TV anime series Dancouga –
                            Super Beast Machine God. This is the series that Yao considers most memorable, and he says
                            it was the show that made him understand what it meant to play an anime character. In
                            addition, Shinobu's line, "I'll do it!" (やってやるぜ！, Yatte yaruze!) is a byword for Yao, and
                            is often quoted in other works. In the arcade game Kaiser Knuckle, in addition to "I'll do
                            it!", he also shouts, "Dancouga!" in some scenes. He also sang a song called "YATTE
                            YARUZE!", which is included in his 1986 album YAO.

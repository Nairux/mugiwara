                                <h2>Roronoa Zoro</h2>
                                <p>Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of
                                    Shimotsuki
                                    Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a
                                    matrilineal descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the
                                    legendary
                                    samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style
                                    which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of
                                    the
                                    three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are
                                    referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in
                                    the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend
                                    Kuina.
                                </p>

                                <p>In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his
                                    sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with
                                    Luffy to be
                                    included among the eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the
                                    Red Line
                                    with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. He, the other
                                    ten
                                    Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst
                                    Generation."</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Zoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned skin. He always carries
                                    his
                                    three swords along with him, bundled up with a green haramaki over his right hip,
                                    allowing
                                    him to easily draw them with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his
                                    person, he has
                                    always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords have varied
                                    over
                                    time due to them being destroyed and subsequently replaced with progressively better
                                    ones.
                                    Although his right hand is usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand
                                    to pull
                                    his swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on his left
                                    earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it
                                    around
                                    his head when he is fighting seriously against an opponent.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Zoro's body is covered with scars from his many battles, most notably the massive
                                    scar
                                    stretching from his left shoulder to his right hip that he acquired during his loss
                                    against
                                    the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, at Baratie. His other visible scars
                                    are the
                                    scars he inflicted upon his ankles in a desperate attempt to free himself from Mr.
                                    3's
                                    Tokudai Candle Service Set by trying to cut his feet off at Little Garden. After the
                                    timeskip, he gained another scar over his left eye, obtained through unknown means.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Zoro's other remarkable feature is his cropped green hair, which Sanji often teases
                                    him
                                    about by calling him "marimo" (moss-ball, moss-head in the VIZ manga and Funimation
                                    dub) due
                                    to its resemblance to one.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>Similar to most of his male crewmates, Zoro has the same outfit throughout most of
                                    the
                                    series. Before the timeskip, he would consistently wear black trousers tucked inside
                                    black
                                    boots, a plain white shirt with three undone buttons at the collar and his green
                                    haramaki.
                                    However, only Zoro's shirt varies from time to time in the arcs.
                                </p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>
                                    During and after the two-year timeskip, Zoro gains a new scar running down over his
                                    left
                                    eye, which is now implied to be critically injured, as it is always closed. His
                                    frame gets
                                    larger, showing considerably more muscle mass, and his hair has gotten shaggier,
                                    while
                                    slicked back. Zoro now wears a long, open dark-green coat closed on his waist that's
                                    held by
                                    a red sash, into which his three swords are tucked. His black bandanna is tied
                                    around his
                                    left forearm. His coat exposes his bare chest, revealing his green haramaki
                                    underneath the
                                    coat. He has also grown noticeably taller, as he is similar in height to Robin.

                                <p class="mt-2">Zoro has devoted his life to becoming the world's strongest swordsman.
                                    Even
                                    before joining the crew, he was well-renowned for his outstanding abilities and
                                    accomplishments in battle. His skills drastically improved after becoming the
                                    combatant of
                                    the Straw Hat Pirates and entering a two-year training period under the "Strongest
                                    Swordsman
                                    in the World", Dracule Mihawk.</b></p>

                                <p>By the time he met Luffy, Zoro had established himself as a fearsome bounty hunter in
                                    the
                                    East Blue, so much so that Koby had heard he was a "demon in the form of a man". His
                                    accomplishments in hunting pirates were significant enough to earn him the epithet
                                    of
                                    "Pirate Hunter", which he remains known for even after becoming a pirate. After his
                                    crushing loss to Dracule Mihawk, he vowed never to lose again. Since joining the
                                    crew,
                                    Zoro has defeated several mighty adversaries (most of whom are fellow swordsmen).
                                </p>
                                <p>Alongside Luffy and Sanji, Zoro is considered one of the Monster Trio (怪物三人組,
                                    Kaibutsu
                                    San-ningumi) of the Straw Hats due to his strength. In some instances, he has even
                                    been mistaken as the leader of the Straw Hats due to his more extensive reputation;
                                    onlookers have also wondered how he could not be the captain after seeing
                                    demonstrations of
                                    his power. During the crew's journey, Zoro has come to possess some of the most
                                    legendary swords in history and has used them to both improve his skills and develop
                                    the
                                    most devastating attacks.</p>
                                <h4>Swordsmanship</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Zoro is an extremely skilled and talented swordsman; training at the Isshin Dojo in
                                    Shimotsuki Village from childhood, he was able to consistently defeat adult
                                    swordsmen in
                                    duels, while Kuina being the one person he could not beat. After reaching adulthood,
                                    he
                                    became a great master swordsman infamous for wielding three swords in battle.[104]
                                    Since
                                    Zoro's goal is to become the World's Strongest Swordsman, he devoted himself to
                                    swordsmanship, becoming known across the East Blue. When confronting Dracule Mihawk,
                                    the
                                    World's Strongest Swordsman, two-years prior, he was utterly outclassed by Hawk-Eye
                                    wielding
                                    Kogatana before deciding to pull out Yoru.[106] However, Mihawk was impressed by
                                    Zoro's
                                    conviction and let him live, believing he could reach the top and challenge him.
                                    Several
                                    months later, Zoro would train under Mihawk for two years and further increased his
                                    abilities exponentially. Also, despite the loss of sight in his left eye during the
                                    timeskip, it has not yet been shown to be a liability for Zoro in any of his
                                    battles.

                                <p>
                                    Zoro has managed to fight off and defeat large groups of skilled opponents on his
                                    own, with
                                    his most notable accomplishment in this field being when he singlehandedly defeated
                                    a group
                                    of 100 bounty hunters from Baroque Works, a powerful criminal organization. Weeks
                                    later
                                    on Kuraigana Island, he managed to fight and eventually defeat a large horde of
                                    Humandrills,
                                    giant monkeys with advanced combat skills, adaptive learning, and inhuman
                                    durability,
                                    despite sustaining severe wounds prior to arriving there. Even Dracule Mihawk
                                    himself was
                                    stunned to learn that the Humandrills had been defeated. Despite adept at dealing
                                    with attacks from multiple opponents simultaneously, Zoro could not always keep it
                                    up, most
                                    so if said opponents are skilled in their own right. This was shown in Wano, when
                                    Gyukimaru's sudden attack distracted Zoro enough to allow Kamazo to strike him,
                                    though he
                                    still defeated him.
                                </p>

                                <p>Although, Zoro is famous for wielding three swords, becoming known as the Three Sword
                                    Style,
                                    he is proficient enough to wield either two swords and even one, the former being
                                    his
                                    original style. In the event that he either opts to not use Three Sword Style or
                                    does not have a third sword, Zoro would instead use Two Sword Style in fighting
                                    against an
                                    opponent, most often more than one or a strong opponent. However, surprising enough,
                                    several
                                    of Zoro's finishing moves involves using one sword despite once claiming that "not
                                    that good
                                    at one-sword techniques" against Sham. Having gotten used to One Sword Style, he
                                    could
                                    defeat multiple powerful opponents, one notable example being the time he
                                    decapitated the
                                    very large and tough, Dragon Number Thirteen proceeding the timeskip, with a single
                                    strike
                                    aimed at its neck.</p>
                                <h4>Haki</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Zoro is one of the very few people in the world who is capable of using all three
                                    types of
                                    Haki.
                                </p>
                                <p>Zoro possesses the ability to use Haoshoku Haki, a very rare form of Haki whose users
                                    are
                                    stated to have the qualities of a "king". This power has laid dormant within Zoro
                                    and he was
                                    unaware he possesses it. He was first noted to have it by Kaidou after the Emperor
                                    was
                                    struck by Zoro's Ashura Bakkei: Moja no Tawamure.
                                </p>
                                <p>Zoro is an extremely skilled user of Busoshoku Haki. It became his main expertise,
                                    having learned it from Dracule Mihawk, mastering both hardening and imbuement during
                                    the
                                    two-year timeskip, turning them black. Despite this, hardening is often used during
                                    serious battles, as well as using this Busoshoku Haki to harm Logia users, as seen
                                    when he
                                    imbued it into a flying slash, wounding Monet.
                                </p>
                                <p>In Wano, Zoro once again showed his mastery through Enma's test, a Meito notorious
                                    for
                                    draining the "Ryuo", their term for Busoshoku Haki from weaker swordsman, turning
                                    them into
                                    a husk. It, in fact, drained the Haki from him, emaciating his right arm, however,
                                    Zoro
                                    retook all the drained Haki seconds later. During the Raid on Onigashima, he managed
                                    to
                                    gain some control over Enma, emanating a flame-like aura, and to wound Kaidou's
                                    dragon
                                    form, same as Kozuki Oden, the Nine Red Scabbards, and Luffy. It was not until Zoro
                                    wielded his Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki together, strengthening his Nine Sword
                                    Style, that
                                    he was able to permanently scar Kaidou in his Human-Beast Form. Against King, Zoro
                                    used
                                    Busoshoku Haki to defend himself from a point-blank fiery explosion that covered a

                                        legendary Wano
                                        swordsmith Shimotsuki Kozaburo and previously owned by his granddaughter and

                                        friend Kuina; given to Zoro 11 years ago by Kuina's father Koushirou after her

                                        with Mihawk's Supreme Grade sword Yoru.</li>

                                        upon its owner. Forged by the great Wano swordsmith Kozuki Sukiyaki and given to
                                        Zoro two years ago in Loguetown by the arms dealer Ipponmatsu.</li>
                                    <li> <strong>Enma:</strong> One of the 21 Great Grade Meito. Also forged by
                                        Shimotsuki Kozaburo and was
                                        originally wielded by the legendary samurai, Kozuki Oden. Oden's daughter,

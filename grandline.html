                        <h2>Grand Line</h2>
                        <p>The Grand Line is an ocean route which wraps around the entire world, south of the North and
                            East Blues and north of the South and West Blues. It is separated from the Blues on both the
                            north and south ends by the Calm Belt. The Grand Line is split into two sections by the Red
                            Line: the first section is known as Paradise and the second is known as the New World.</p>

                        <p>Reputed as the "pirate's graveyard," the sea and the islands possess a vast number of
                            unpredictable phenomena that are not seen anywhere else in the world, many of which make
                            sailing extremely difficult. Additionally, the Grand Line is home to the world's most
                            powerful people and groups, including the Three Great Powers. Only one group, the Roger
                            Pirates, has managed to fully sail across the Grand Line, and this achievement is what
                            caused their captain Gol D. Roger to be labeled as the "Pirate King".</p>

                        <p>The Grand Line serves as the setting of most of the series, with almost everything since the
                            Arabasta Saga being set in it.</p>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>The Grand Line is the gigantic sea route that circles around the planet, stretching from west
                            to east. It follows an imaginary line that runs from north-west to south-east across the
                            middle of the world and perpendicular to the Red Line, a vast ring-like continent that
                            circles the globe from north-east to south-west.[5][6] The main importance of the Grand Line
                            is that it is the only way to circumnavigate the globe.
                        </p>
                        <p>he Grand Line and the Red Line crossing each other is what divides the rest of the Blue Sea
                            into four oceans[7]: the North Blue, the East Blue, the West Blue, and the South Blue.[7] As
                            such, they are key to worldwide trade and travel in that the Lines are placed along the
                            paths between the Blues. This makes them valuable routes of travel and obstacles for both
                            pirates and civilians alike.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This stretch of ocean is said to be the most dangerous place in the world, and is commonly
                            referred to as the Pirates' Graveyard (海賊の墓場, Kaizoku no Hakaba) by people from the Four
                            Blues due to the presence of the Three Great Powers over it. Despite the reputation of
                            the Grand Line being dangerous and chaotic, many normal people manage a living on individual
                            islands regardless, having adapted to their home land. This indicates that it is actually
                            traveling within the Line itself that is dangerous, as it virtually guarantees facing
                            unpredictable climates and dangerous wildlife. However, there are also several islands, or
                            portions of the islands, which are considered dangerous in their own right, and thus, they
                            are either uninhabited or the citizens have taken precaution to the threat.

                        <p class="mt-2">The Grand Line is divided by the Red Line into two halves. The first half,
                            stretching from Reverse Mountain to the polar opposite point of the Red Line, is known as
                            "Paradise". The second half, which starts beyond the second Red Line point to the
                            backside of Reverse Mountain, is known as the "New World".</b></p>

                        <h4>Paradise</h4>
                        <p>The first half of the Grand Line is known as Paradise (楽園パラダイス, Paradaisu). Its name
                            comes from people who have returned from the second half, claiming that the first half is
                            like a paradise in comparison. It lies between East Blue and South Blue.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Paradise stretches from the Twin Cape to the Sabaody Archipelago. Of the few pirate crews
                            that are actually strong and skilled enough to hold their own in the Grand Line, a very
                            small number of them actually make it all the way to Sabaody.

                        <h4>New World</h4>
                        <p>
                            The second half of the Grand Line is known as the New World (新世界, Shinsekai). Its name
                            comes from it being “a whole new world of adventure” compared to the first half. It lies
                            between North Blue and West Blue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This stretch of the sea is where a number of powerful groups, including the Four Emperors
                            reside, each holding their own respective territory. Marine Headquarters is also located
                            in the New World, following its relocation after the Summit War of Marineford.
                        </p>
                        <p>The only people known to have explored the New World entirely in the last 800 years are the
                            Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, and his crew, the Roger Pirates.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2">The weather is unusual on the Grand Line to say the least, the standard rules of
                            meteorology don’t apply. The ocean currents and weather patterns are extremely volatile and
                            inconsistent, they can drastically change in an instant; this includes water spouts, storms,
                            blizzards, heat waves, thick fog, and many other such things. There are also cyclones
                            that seem to appear quickly and suddenly, they are remarked as being impossible to
                            predict.</p>
                        <p>The reason for these erratic currents and weather is because the islands on the Grand Line
                            each have a distinct climate year round, most often falling into one of four basic
                            categories: Summer, Spring, Autumn, and Winter. These types of islands each have four
                            seasons of their own, ranging from Summer Island summer to Winter Island winter, giving the
                            Grand Line a total of 16 different seasons. That’s not including islands with climates
                            that differ from the basic four. It is the clashing weather patterns and magnetic waves
                            generated from each island that causes the strange and unpredictable conditions on the open
                            seas between islands.</p>
                        <p>
                            Notably, the first leg of the Grand Line is especially chaotic. There are seven different
                            paths that one can choose from to sail through. The clashing weather and magnetism of those
                            first seven islands cause insane sailing conditions that are beyond nearly anything else in
                            the first half of the Grand Line.
                        </p>
                        <p>The only areas where the weather and currents are stabilized and predictable are the Islands
                            and their nearby surrounding waters. This doesn’t mean the weather will be calm and sunny,
                            it just means that the climate won’t suddenly swift as it does on the open ocean.</p>

                        <p>A normal compass won’t work on the Grand Line due to each island generating its own magnetic
                            field. In order to navigate the Grand Line, one needs a special type of compass known as a
                            Log Pose.</p>

                        <p>The Log Pose works by locking on to the magnetism produced by one island and points toward
                            that island. After reaching said island and staying there for a certain amount of time, the
                            Log Pose will reset and start locking on to the magnetism of the next island. The time it
                            takes for a Log Pose to set is different on each island; it may take a few hours, it may
                            take a few days, or even a full year.</p>

                        <p>A Log Pose for the first half of the Grand Line has only a single needle. Alternatively, a
                            Log Pose for the second half has three needles. Each of the three needles locks on to the
                            magnetic waves of one of three different islands. This is because islands in the New World
                            tend to experience changes in their magnetism. Therefore, if you lose the magnetism of one
                            island, you still have two backup options. Furthermore, changes in magnetism can be caused
                            by abnormalities on the island, the unstable magnetism of the island resulting in the
                            corresponding needle jiggling. The trick is to follow the needle that is most stable. </p>

                        <p>There is another type of Log Pose known as an Eternal Pose. This version of the Log Pose is
                            permanently locked on to the magnetism of a specific island and never resets. This makes it
                            easier for a crew to get to a specific island, rather than following a regular Log Pose
                            through a trail of islands.</p>

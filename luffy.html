                                <h2>Monkey D. Luffy</h2>
                                <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the
                                    founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as
                                    well as
                                    the most powerful of its top fighters. He desires to find the legendary treasure
                                    left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which would
                                    help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his
                                    brothers, and
                                    crew. He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the
                                    world.</p>

                                <p>Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the
                                    Revolutionary
                                    Army, and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,, where their family
                                    carries the initial of D. At age 7, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi,
                                    which turned
                                    his body into rubber. Shanks also gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become
                                    Luffy's
                                    signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to
                                    meet again
                                    someday after he became a great pirate. Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of
                                    Curly Dadan, Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist"
                                    Portgas
                                    D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo.</p>

                                <p>Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting
                                    the most
                                    powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven
                                    Warlords
                                    of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line,
                                    emerging
                                    victorious in a majority of these battles. He invaded and indirectly caused the
                                    annihilation
                                    of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a focal figure in the
                                    Summit War
                                    of Marineford. He has also either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known
                                    past or
                                    present Warlords prior to the organization's dissolution. Furthermore, Luffy has
                                    invaded the
                                    territory of the Four Emperors on multiple occasions and eventually managed to
                                    defeat one.
                                    Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous
                                    Future
                                    Element" while in the process gaining a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some
                                    cases,
                                    "insane," earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and
                                    even the
                                    World Government.</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and
                                    a slim
                                    muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark straw hat (from which he gets his
                                    nickname
                                    "Straw Hat Luffy"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate
                                    captain,
                                    "Red-Haired" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger. He wears blue shorts
                                    with cuffs, sandals, and a sleeveless red vest. Luffy also has a scar with two
                                    stitches
                                    underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show
                                    Shanks that
                                    he was tough enough to be a pirate. He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit
                                    War
                                    of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>Similar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of
                                    the
                                    series. Luffy will often wear a different outfit to suit the climate of an island
                                    (such as a
                                    hooded parka on Drum Island or desert robes in Arabasta) but will switch back to his
                                    trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over.
                                    Despite
                                    this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport
                                    other
                                    miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and
                                    Sabaody
                                    Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to
                                    dress
                                    stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team
                                    members, Nami,
                                    Usopp, Sanji, and Robin.
                                </p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>
                                    After those two years, a few things have changed. He has grown slightly taller and
                                    is shown
                                    to be significantly more muscular due to his training. This can be seen in his
                                    slightly
                                    thicker neck, more pronounced deltoids, and a better-defined chest, which shows the
                                    X-shaped
                                    scar he received by then-Admiral Akainu covering most of it. His usual attire is
                                    mostly
                                    the same as it was two years ago, but instead of a vest, Luffy wears an open,
                                    long-sleeved
                                    red cardigan with four buttons, with a yellow sash tied around his waist (somewhat
                                    reminiscent of Gol D. Roger's outfit).
                                </p>
                                <p>Due to Luffy's increasing notoriety in addition to the increasing strength of his
                                    foes, after
                                    the timeskip he finds himself more often dressed in disguises to mask his identity,
                                    with
                                    varying levels of sophistication. Despite this, he still never loses his trademark
                                    straw hat
                                    and instead opts to at times cover it with other headwear.</p>

                                    the
                                    four most powerful pirates in the world. He captains the Straw Hat Pirates, holding
                                    the
                                    greatest authority over a mighty and diverse crew consisting of several infamous

                                    many of whom are extremely powerful in their own right. Luffy has a tremendous

                                    influence over his crewmates, so much so that they all trust him with their lives,

                                    his reckless behavior and, in some cases, even because of it.</p>

                                <p>Luffy is a fierce and formidable combatant who can invent extremely creative fighting
                                    techniques even during intense battles and has gone through harsh and rigorous
                                    training ever
                                    since he was a child. He has been taught by two legendary figures, his grandfather

                                    Garp, the "Hero of the Marines", and Silvers Rayleigh, the retired first mate of
                                    the
                                    Pirate King's crew. Despite acting goofy and eccentric most of the time, Luffy
                                    has
                                    proven to be a natural born leader.

                                <h4>Devil Fruit</h4>
                                <p>
                                    When he was 7 years old, Luffy unwittingly ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a Paramecia-type
                                    Devil
                                    Fruit, after finding it in a chest owned by the Red Hair Pirates. It gives his body
                                    the
                                    properties of rubber, allowing him to stretch, bounce, bend, twist, and inflate any
                                    part of
                                    his body. Initially, Luffy was unable to control his stretching, but was able to
                                    master it after ten years of training on Dawn Island, and further master it during
                                    the two
                                    years he spent training with Silvers Rayleigh on Rusukaina.

                                    During the Wano Country Arc, it was revealed that it is actually a Mythical
                                    Zoan-type Devil
                                    Fruit, the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, which allows the user to become an
                                    incarnation of
                                    Nika, an ever-playful Sun God known for liberating slaves and bringing smiles to
                                    people's
                                    faces. This grants Luffy's body a rubber physiology and allows him to fight however
                                    he
                                    pleases, just as long as he can imagine it. According to the Five Elder St. Shepherd
                                    Ju
                                    Peter, because of the smiles Nika can put on the faces of others, he is known as the
                                    "Warrior of Liberation", and that "there is no power more ridiculous in all the
                                    world".

                                <h4>Haki</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Luffy is one of the few people in the world capable of using all three types of
                                    Haki, and so
                                    far, he is one of only two people in the series to be confirmed to be capable of
                                    utilizing
                                    the advanced application of all three types, the other being Kaidou. Most notably,
                                    Silvers
                                    Rayleigh, the former first mate and right-hand man of Gol D. Roger, instructed him
                                    during
                                    the two-year timeskip, and stated he has a noticeable talent for Haki, having
                                    mastered the
                                    basic applications of all three forms of Haki in only a year and a half.
                                </p>
                                <p>Even before finding out what Haki was, Blackbeard noted that his Haki had grown
                                    stronger by
                                    the time of the mass breakout in Impel Down compared to their first meeting on Jaya.
                                </p>
                                <p>Through fighting against and training with powerful Haki users in the New World, in
                                    particular, those related to the Four Emperors, in addition to the Emperors
                                    themselves,
                                    Luffy strengthened his skill with each form of Haki to a much greater degree and
                                    learned how
                                    to use their advanced applications.

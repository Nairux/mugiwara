                                <h2>Tony Tony Chopper</h2>
                                <p>Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper, is the doctor of
                                    the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand
                                    Fleet. He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join, doing so at the
                                    end of the Drum Island Arc. He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates
                                    during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.</p>

                                <p>Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows its
                                    user to transform into a human hybrid at will. He was taught medicine on Drum Island
                                    by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha. Chopper aims to travel all
                                    across the world in the hopes of accomplishing his dream of being able to cure any
                                    disease.</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Most of the time, Chopper is a toddler-sized human/reindeer hybrid, but his Devil
                                    Fruit abilities allow him to change his appearance depending on the situation.
                                    Chopper's left antler is braced at the base by a metal plate because it was
                                    reattached after being broken during his search for the Amiudake when he was younger
                                    (where he thought the Amiudake can cure Hiriluk's disease) and ran into the leader
                                    of his old herd, who severely injured him. He usually wears a large pale
                                    red/pink fuzzy top hat with a sideways medical cross (given to him by Hiriluk) and a
                                    maroon pair of shorts. He also sometimes wears a blue backpack that has the same
                                    sideways medical cross as his hat. He also has a remarkable blue nose. As Oda's
                                    style evolved and many readers commented on how cute Chopper was, Chopper has been
                                    given a much more "chibi" like appearance, meaning that when in his preferred
                                    transformation (which he calls Brain Point), he has a larger head and eyes and a
                                    less defined muzzle than earlier in the series. Many female characters, such as
                                    Nami, Robin, Makino, Porche, Shakky, and Vivi find Chopper very cute. There are even
                                    males that find Chopper cute such as Foxy and Breed.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>Similar to most of his male crewmates, Chopper has the same outfit throughout most of
                                    the series.
                                </p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>
                                    After two years, Chopper is significantly leaner. He is less potbellied than he was
                                    in earlier seasons and his arms/forelimbs are also skinnier. It is arguable that
                                    since leaving the cold climate on Drum Island, he has lost significant body fat. The
                                    color of his fur has changed from brown to gold, and according to Nami (when she and
                                    Chopper reunite on Sabaody), the texture has gotten softer.
                                </p>
                                <p>Chopper now wears a blue cap that has a ring of dots around the circle, while the cap
                                    has buckles hanging from it. He wears this over his old pink hat. He also wears
                                    a white and yellow vertical-striped tank top, which he takes off when he transforms
                                    into Heavy Point, and an orange pair of shorts. Aside from being slightly slimmer
                                    and having his fur changing from dark brown into a light brown color, Chopper's
                                    Brain Point form has not changed. His Walk Point (reindeer) form has grown
                                    considerably, now being roughly as tall as Usopp. His horns are larger, he has more
                                    muscle, and his fur is longer. His Heavy Point has become exceedingly larger and
                                    more muscular, being almost the size of Dosun's. He also developed new
                                    transformations through his research during the timeskip, which he debuts on
                                    Fish-Man Island, including Kung Fu Point (which he uses to defeat Neptune's
                                    soldiers) and a revised Horn Point (which he uses against Daruma).</p>

                                <p class="mt-2">Typically, it is rare for doctors to fulfill roles other than medical
                                    practices for the benefit of those around them, but as the Straw Hat Pirates'
                                    doctor, Chopper's responsibilities are not limited to just medicine alone.</p>

                                <p>He occasionally performed tasks like steering the ship as their unofficial helmsman
                                    while on the Going Merry, and during the heat of battle, he can also fulfill the
                                    role of a physical fighter to support his friends.
                                </p>
                                <p>However, due in part to his lack of battle experience or formal training (as well as
                                    his Rumble Ball's time limited effect) Chopper was originally considered part of the
                                    "Weakling Trio" along with Nami and Usopp. This lay largely in his lack of
                                    battle intuition and naïveté at the time, though it is shown that he has gotten much
                                    more capable after his two years of training on Torino Kingdom.</p>
                                <h4>Zoolingualism</h4>
                                <p>Because he is originally an animal, Chopper can understand and communicate with other
                                    animals, thus allowing him to serve as a translator between animals and humans. This
                                    was first seen when Chopper translated Karoo's speech on how he ended frozen in the
                                    icy waters of Drum Island next to the Going Merry.</p>
                                <h4>Medical Expertise</h4>
                                <p>Having studied under Dr. Kureha, one of the finest doctors of the medically advanced
                                    Drum Kingdom, Chopper himself is an extraordinary doctor with outstanding knowledge
                                    of both medicine and medical drugs as well as the preparations of most remedies and
                                    ointments that can be made from regular fruits, herbs, roots, and vegetables that
                                    can be found and used on most islands. He is also capable of administering surgery
                                    and resuscitation. Overall, Chopper can treat even the most brutal injuries.</p>
                                <p>During the two years he spent self-studying the Torino Tribe's massive collection of
                                    books on herbalism in the Torino Kingdom, Chopper's knowledge of pharmacology has
                                    immensely increased. In the Torino Kingdom, Chopper self-studied many books of new
                                    and highly effective remedies, ointments, unknown herbs with great healing
                                    properties and other medicinal drugs that were developed by the inhabitants of the
                                    Torino Kingdom which are largely unknown to the rest of the world. With this new
                                    understanding of medicinal drugs, combined with the medical skills he had already
                                    mastered in the Sakura Kingdom, the scope of Chopper's healing skills as a doctor
                                    have become noticeably wider. The greatest example of this is during the Zou Arc, as
                                    Chopper, with the assistance of the Mink Tribe's doctors, was able to use all of
                                    these skills to treat the gigantic, thousand-year-old elephant Zunesha, whose leg
                                    was badly injured by the Beasts Pirates.</p>
                                <p>Chopper was able to invent his very own drug known as the "Rumble Ball", through 5
                                    years of research, which helps to increase his Devil Fruit's fighting
                                    capabilities. In addition, while he was under the apprenticeship of Dr. Kureha,
                                    Chopper became aware of the highly addictive drug NHC10 (which only selected
                                    scientists in selected countries are allowed to use), and its harmful side
                                    effects. He is capable of stabilizing the condition of someone suffering from an
                                    overdose of the drug. Chopper also easily created a cure for one of Queen's
                                    deadliest viruses, the Mummy virus, doing so in a relatively short amount of
                                    time. Furthermore, Chopper knows how to engineer viruses of his own, but
                                    only with the intent of counteracting other viral diseases. He also created a
                                    drug that allows minks to access their Sulong Forms anytime without the need of the
                                    full moon.</p>
                                <h4>Devil Fruit</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Chopper ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to
                                    transform into a human and reindeer-human hybrid at will. It also gave him human
                                    level intelligence and the ability to speak human language. It also allows him to
                                    walk upright on two legs and hold things in his cloven hoof hands. This power is
                                    what allowed Chopper to become a doctor and learn about medicine in the first place,
                                    which is impossible for a normal reindeer.

                                    After the two-year timeskip, Chopper has developed the ability to access the
                                    additional forms at any time and without time limit, without even needing to
                                    actually take the Rumble Ball. Furthermore, both his Horn Point and Guard Point have
                                    developed considerably; both his Horn Point horns, and his protective Guard Point
                                    fluff are much bigger, thicker, and stronger. He has also developed an entirely new
                                    transformation known as Kung Fu Point, he is seen being able to perform formidable
                                    martial art maneuvers with this new form, melding the advantageous characteristics
                                    of Arm Point and Jumping Point.

                                <p>Additionally, he also developed his Monster Point; he now only needs a single Rumble
                                    Ball to enter this form, and he can stay in control of himself, allowing him to
                                    fight in his most powerful form for three minutes. How he managed to advance his
                                    level with the drug is currently unknown.</p>

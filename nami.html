                                <h2>Nami</h2>
                                <p>"Cat Burglar" Nami is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the
                                    Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is the third member of the crew
                                    and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town Arc. She is the adoptive
                                    sister of Nojiko after the two were orphaned and taken in by Bell-mère.</p>

                                <p>She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats
                                    so that she could rob them in order to buy back her village from Arlong. However,
                                    she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and defeated
                                    Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.</p>

                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Nami is a slim young woman of average height with orange hair and brown eyes. Many
                                    characters seem to consider her to be an attractive woman. She has
                                    a black tattoo (blue in the anime) on her left shoulder, which represents mikan,
                                    and pinwheels (a homage to Bell-mère, Nojiko, and Genzo, respectively), where she
                                    used to have a tattoo for being a member of Arlong's crew.
                                </p>
                                <p>Her overall physique matures slowly throughout the series and then suddenly during
                                    the timeskip (though this is most likely a simple change in style of artwork). Her
                                    fashion frequently changes as does her hair style. Many of her shirts feature
                                    four-letter words, such as "Gold" or "EVIL", similar to a shirt that Bell-mère once
                                    wore that had "MACE" on it. On her left wrist, she wears the Log Pose, which she
                                    needs in order to be the navigator of the ship, and a gold bracelet, given to her by
                                    her sister, Nojiko. After the Arlong Park Arc, Nami frequently changes into a
                                    variety of clothes in the series for each arc, and usually pairs her tops with
                                    skirts that have two rings on the sides. Her trademark shoes are orange high-heeled
                                    gladiator sandals. Nami wears some form of high heels in every arc, and while they
                                    do make her taller, they do not seem to affect the way she walks or her speed.
                                    Though she tends to style her hair neatly, occasionally, a hair on top of her head
                                    may form into a messy cowlick.</p>

                                <h4>Before the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>Before the Syrup Village Arc, Nami wore her trademark orange miniskirt with two white
                                    rings on each side filled in with orange or brown in their centers and shirts with
                                    short sleeves that were long enough to hide her tattoo on her left shoulder that
                                    showed that she was a member of the Arlong Pirates. She also had short hair with a
                                    particularly curled strand over the left side of her face.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During the Arlong Park Arc, Nami wore a green camisole with dark green flower
                                    shapes, tight black pants with two yellow rings on the sides, and light orange
                                    high-heeled sandals. Nami temporarily put on a glove to hide the fact she had
                                    stabbed her hand when pretending to murder Usopp but quit wearing it once the truth
                                    was exposed. She also wore Monkey D. Luffy's straw hat for a while before it was
                                    later returned to him. After the arc, she wore a plain white shirt with a blue
                                    miniskirt with two white rings on the sides. For the first time, she wore sleeveless
                                    clothing that exposed her Arlong Pirates tattoo, but later, in a fit of
                                    uncontrollable rage, Nami later stabbed her tattoo relentlessly in an attempt to
                                    destroy it, until Luffy stopped her by force. She eventually asked Dr. Nako to
                                    remove it, but the doctor couldn't erase it entirely, leaving a visible scar; the
                                    scar had been caused from both Nami repeatedly wounding herself in the arm and the
                                    indelible nature of the tattoo. Nami chose to cover it up by getting a new tattoo
                                    which was a cross between a tangerine and a pinwheel, in honor of both Bell-mère and
                                    Genzo. Nojiko also gave her a gold bracelet as a keepsake before she departed from
                                    her home, which Nami began to wear regularly on her left wrist ever since.
                                </p>
                                <h4>After the Timeskip</h4>
                                <p>
                                    From the Return to Sabaody Arc through the Fish-Man Island Arc, Nami's hair has
                                    grown rather long, which reaches her lower back. A single long hair stand hanging on
                                    the left side with bangs still hanging over her forehead. Her breasts have also
                                    grown much larger/rounder similar to Nico Robin's, but apart from this, her
                                    appearance has not changed much, save for the fact that both her body curves and
                                    hourglass figure have become more pronounced. Oddly, Nami's face is now drawn to
                                    look younger with her eyes bigger (with the irises now showing), droopier and placed
                                    lower on her face; though this may be from the art style evolving. She also has
                                    grown slightly taller. After the timeskip, her outfit consists of a revealing green
                                    and white bikini halter top, tight low-rider jeans (that expose a bit of her hips
                                    and rear), orange high-heeled sandals and a pair of pearl-like earrings that she
                                    constantly wears. Ever since arriving to the New World, Nami sports a new belt that
                                    is black with a "Beli" symbol on it where she can also keep the pieces of her
                                    Sorcery Clima-Tact on the right side and puts the belt around her waist when she is
                                    fighting seriously against an opponent.
                                </p>

                                    <p class="mt-2">Being the assigned navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami is
                                        responsible for evaluating the direction that the ship goes as they sail further
                                        into the sea. Nami also tends to act as the crew's de facto treasurer, managing
                                        the crew's money and allocating spending money whenever they arrive at a new
                                        location.</b></p>

                                    <p>Nami is an accomplished and agile polearm user. Knowing she lacks the raw
                                        strength of most of her crewmembers she uses her cunning and specially designed
                                        weapons to combat opponents who are her physical superiors. While she tries to
                                        avoid combat as much as possible, when the need arises Nami gives her all in
                                        battle and has defeated some fearsome fighters.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Despite being one of the weakest members of the crew, Nami nonetheless possesses
                                        a strong enough will to be able to withstand a burst of Big Mom's Haoshoku Haki
                                        just like the rest of her crewmates.</p>

                                    <h4>Navigation and Cartography Expertise</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Nami is a highly skilled navigator and an extremely talented cartographer.
                                        Arlong considered her skills on par with the fish-men "superiority" since they
                                        were superior to any fish-man's. When Luffy destroyed her room at Arlong Park,
                                        both bathymetric and geographic maps were seen, proving that Nami has a wide
                                        variety of cartographic skills.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        She is capable of formulating advanced equations in mere minutes to predict a
                                        precise course of action, although she usually needs to write the equations down
                                        on a physical medium when formulating them. She has a supernatural ability to
                                        sense changes in the weather, "with her body" according to Vivi, and can even
                                        predict the emergence of supposedly unpredictable cyclones in the Grand Line,
                                        undeterred even by a high fever. This ability, combined with her years of
                                        knowledge in cartography and navigation, has also made Nami an expert in
                                        meteorology. Not only has she been shown to continuously and accurately predict
                                        various normal weather conditions, but she is also capable of predicting and
                                        handling the almost unnatural, unpredictable, and inexplicable weather
                                        conditions of the Grand Line, being more than capable of navigating through
                                        these conditions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This attribute proved useful during Nami's one-on-one altercation with Enel,
                                        where she managed to deflect several of the Goro Goro no Mi user's
                                        lightning-based attacks using only "Thunder Balls" from her first Clima-Tact. It
                                        could be assumed that after the timeskip, her navigation skills have greatly
                                        improved due to her study of the New World climate with the help of Haredas, as
                                        even Caribou immediately recognized and praised her skills as a navigator during
                                        their descent to Fish-Man Island.

                                    <h4>Skilled Thief and Pickpocket</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Apart from her navigational skills, Nami has also proven herself to be an
                                        excellent thief and a master pickpocket. She is able to take small items, such
                                        as keys, without her victims noticing, a skill she honed from a young age. Her
                                        most notable thieving feat was shown just before she left her village. At the
                                        harbor, she stole numerous wallets from the villagers saying goodbye to her
                                        while she was running past them, and among the villagers and the Straw Hats,
                                        plus Johnny and Yosaku, no one noticed until she revealed what she had done.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>She now uses this skill to steal from other pirates, and occasionally government
                                        employees, more often than not sneaking aboard their ship or base and taking all
                                        their valuables while they are distracted by some fight. Her skill at thievery
                                        has even been recognized by the World Government and has earned her the epithet
                                        "Cat Burglar".
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Art of Weather</h4>
                                    <p>Nami's fighting style focuses mainly on using the Clima-Tact to manipulate the
                                        weather of her surroundings, also known as the "Art of Weather". When combined
                                        with her immense knowledge of meteorology and weather systems, this ability can
                                        be used for devastating results.</p>
                                    <h5>Clima-Tact</h5>
                                    <p>Nami first gained the ability to manipulate the weather when Usopp gave her the
                                        Clima-Tact. The flaw with his invention, however, was that it was primarily for
                                        party tricks. Regardless of this conflict, due to her expertise she was able
                                        to combine several of its functions in order to pull off dangerous and useful
                                        techniques, like creating a mirage of herself, (Mirage Tempo) in order to
                                        distract her opponent, and a powerful lightning cloud (Thunderbolt Tempo),
                                        which was used on Miss Doublefinger, who thought she was a magician.</p>
                                    <h5>Perfect Clima-Tact</h5>
                                    <p>After the Skypiea Arc, Usopp improved the Clima-Tact with Dials, creating the
                                        Perfect Clima-Tact. This improvement gave her much greater power over the
                                        weather, allowing her to easily pull off stronger and newer versions of the
                                        tricks she could do with the Clima-Tact, like creating duplicates of herself
                                        using mist (Mirage Tempo: Fata Morgana). This weapon was also powerful enough to
                                        allow her to wipe out hordes of Marines with Thunderbolt Tempo and defeat CP9's
                                        Kalifa with Thunder Lance Tempo. There was still a flaw in its use, however, as
                                        Nami was unable to properly control the lightning and her allies would sometimes
                                        sustain collateral damage.</p>
                                    <h5>Sorcery Clima-Tact</h5>
                                    <p>After the timeskip, her abilities are greatly enhanced, being able to easily
                                        destroy a bar and a submarine (and harm the occupants of both) with lightning
                                        blasts that can be compared to an attack by Enel. At the stand-off between
                                        Neptune's soldiers with Usopp and Brook, she wielded the upgraded version of the
                                        Clima-Tact with the disappearance of the balls, which she now calls the Sorcery
                                        Clima-Tact. When the Straw Hats arrived at Gyoncorde Plaza, Nami's "Mirage
                                        Tempo" was shown to have improved to the point of making herself appear
                                        completely invisible, and she was also able to shoot a powerful gust of wind she
                                        named Gust Sword to easily dispatch a fish-man.</p>
                                    <p>She can now use and create weather in more creative ways, like launching an egg
                                        which hatches to release a large thundercloud that she can then take control of
                                        in order to strike down her opponent(s), which she calls "Thunder Breed Tempo",
                                        and creating an orb at the end of one of the three segments of her Clima-Tact
                                        which possesses enough heat to melt snow and harm a snow woman like Monet (Heat
                                        Egg). This new Clima-Tact has also been proven to not only be useful for battle
                                        situations, but regular daily uses as well, such as taking showers (Shower
                                        Tempo) and making paths for travel with sea clouds (Milky Road). The latter is
                                        an achievement of its own as sea clouds were shown not to be produced in the
                                        Blue Sea.</p>
